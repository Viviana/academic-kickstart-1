I am broadly interested in researching **the health of the internet**, which entails studying *disinformation/misinformation*, *polarization*, and *propaganda*. I use computational methods to track the networked diffusion and mobilization of ideas and people on digital platforms. 

Most of my works are conducted in the context of the internet in the US. As a Chinese-born scholar, I have also taken a keen interest in observing the evolution of the Chinese digital society.
