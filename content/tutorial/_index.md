# COMM497DB Spring 2019

I am developing a set of interactive tutorials on using R for social data analytics. Throughout the semester, I will update the tutorials bi-weekly to include new topics. 

#### Access [the interactive tutorial](https://curiositybits.shinyapps.io/R_social_data_analytics/)

##### New features in the new version
  - Interactive
  - Cloud-based; you don't need to have R and RStudio on your local machine
  - Embedded with a Twitter developer account to enable API access
 
--- 
# Tutorials used in previous semesters
The old tutorials are not interactive. They are R Markdown documents hosted on RPubs. With new libraries and changes to Twitter/Facebook API, some content may have become obsolete.
