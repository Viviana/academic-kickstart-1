"5",25904410,326571266,2018-09-22,191383952,"Christina","We were told a week before arrival to go to a different address, which was fine. However, the place didn't look clean and was not slightly better than the original address as stated by Matthew. Keys were not in lockbox at the time of check-in (5pm). Was told the previous guests took the keys home with them and Matthew would bring us the keys after work. However, he wasn't communicative about when that would be so we were out a longer time than intended. WiFi didn't work during the stay and we told him about it. Body wash was watered down and there was no extra. The apartment itself didn't feel private because there was a balcony connecting the windows and there was no curtains. The location was good. Other than the body wash, the rest of the amenities were decent. Not worth it for the price though.","Boston"

"9",14474750,301144085,2018-08-03,36923306,"Federico","Casa molto bella ed elegante, ben attrezzata e provvista di tutto, sita in un tranquillo quartiere residenziale di Boston. La stazione della metro (Green Street) non è vicinissima (circa 20 - 25 minuti a piedi), mentre più vicino ci sono le fermate dell'autobus. Jeff è molto cordiale e celere nel rispondere. Un po' calde le stanze, soprattutto quella sulla sinistra delle scale, nonostante il ventilatore. Straconsigliata, specialmente in primavera/autunno.","Boston"

The place is huge, very clean, all beds (including the sofa bed) really comfortable with good linens. Large kitchen and bathrooms. My toddler who normally doesn't stay much indoor was able to hang out inside all day with his grandparents while I was at work. Good neighborhood with a corner store, microbrewery, coffee shop and playground. We never stayed in JP before and enjoyed it. It feels really local. All the communication was easy and prompt. Affordable given the size and proximity to downtown. Will definitely come back","Boston"

The space is super cozy and has all amenities for a long or short stay. The apartment is spotlessly clean and the shower has excellent pressure. Located a very short walk from a train station on a quiet street very near the airport. Cloe is an excellent host and was very easy to deal with.","Boston"

"20",15833104,269527580,2018-05-27,58071912,"Phil","Overall great experience. Check in was a little confusing (didn't know we had to check in online before we would get check in instructions) The flat had great air conditioning (Which was great considering it was very very hot during our trip) had free coffee, soaps, etc and was in a fantastic location. Very close to the commons & 30 min walk to Fenway. 

Would recommend staying if you are ever in Boston.","Boston"

"23",10231171,261462814,2018-05-06,116447366,"Aubrey","When booking a room, my only requirements are a comfy bed and a hot shower. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed as there was no hot water at all. Joe’s place is not worth $100 a night. There was a strict house rule of quiet hours beginning at 10pm, yet someone was doing dishes well into midnight. Which wouldn’t be an issue but you could hear everything going on in the apartment. I am normally very easy to please but I left feeling ripped off and disappointed.","Boston"
"24",21941640,327859072,2018-09-24,184101983,"Peter","Excellent location. When flying in it is so easy to get to. From the free shuttle to the airport subway station it is only an easy 10-15 minute walk.","Boston"

Everything is right around the corner, and the apartment itself is cozy, spacious and just what we needed. Totally recommendable!","Boston"

"30",23130922,262031193,2018-05-07,107711795,"Kim","Great location! A lot of the better restaurants are on Newbury street (approx 30 min walk) but there’s still a good variety of restaurants within a 10-15 min walk. Plan to do a lot of walking because parking prices are higher than average. The place is small but for the price, it is half of all the hotels I found. It does have everything you need (towels, plenty of water, AC and fan, etc). The biggest downside is the pillows are very flat, so it was hard to sleep every night for my boyfriend and I. Some other minor things to keep in mind, we woke up with some bug bites in the morning but never saw an actual bug and sometimes the hot water doesn’t last very long in the shower. Would probably stay here again.","Boston"

"35",15569507,340302817,2018-10-23,151269848,"Daniela","This hostess does not respect the reservation commitment made in advance, does not respond to contacts and concelued our reservation on the day of the stay, leaving us in a critical situation with no place to stay, as the city was crowded and with no other possibilities of stay because of the Red Sox games. Her lack of commitment to our reservation made our trip sad and unhappy. Because of this situation we had to spend more money than the
expected, because what we found available were values much higher than
we could spend and in places far away from what we plan to stay.
I would not recommend this hostess to anyone as it can ruin your trip as well.","Boston"
"36",17625675,295954293,2018-07-24,74988435,"Prabjot","It is perfect for the price, one washroom to be shared with 4 rooms, so have to wait in morning to take shower. Bedroom was clean, smells fresh, air conditioner for every room.
I didn’t like the neighbourhood, will not feel safe walking their at night. Again that’s the reason it is lot cheaper.
I will go their again.","Boston"

Shared with a family of 4 who were a bit noisy but not the hosts fault. Would stay again for sure. The value and proximity to Red Line and where I work when in Boston is totally worth it.","Boston"

The host immediately responded to all questions and was so nice and hospitable. This is worth every penny and was perfect for a business trip while working in government center. I was able to walk everywhere and ate at some great restaurants in the neighborhood.","Boston"

There is a beautiful view from out side the back of the house. Definitely watch the video provided before arriving in the dark! Once you do, checking in will be easy. The place was clean. Very minimally appointed, which was fine for a weekend spent mostly out and about. The ceiling is thin so footfall noise from the house above is very loud.","Boston"

Back bay station is just around the corner making it so easy to get around Boston but also was super handy for us catching the Amtrak train to NYC. We didn’t get to meet Ashley but Dennis and Pickle were very friendly and welcoming and Dennis was able to give us some great tips and information.","Boston"

"46",4447990,279064259,2018-06-19,193880165,"Ashley","This was my first AirBNB, and if any other BNB is anything remotely close to the experience, my family will NEVER stay in a hotel again. This truly was an awesome experience! 

To begin with; I was a bit nervous at first, I typically overspend on well-known hotels, or resorts, assuming that they will reliably provide what it is I’m looking for. John’s place exceeded. It was immaculate, it largely incorporated the homely feeling of the safe, and friendly community it was located in and ultimately added to the experience! We felt as though we were local! The home itself was VERY well kept, and accommodating. It was stocked with all basic necessities and even some extra amenities! My fiancée and I were visiting Boston leisurely and found a very EASY commute through the commuter rail, and also cheap pricing through Uber.  The streets were quiet at night, the ac (which was dire to us in the middle of June) kept the place comfortably cool, and John was even thought to provide laundry soap readily available in the space, when we forgot to even pack ours! The unit itself was obviously very meticulously maintained, clearly it is well kept by himself or exceptional staff frequently.  For my future endeavors Into Boston I will absolutely request to book this gorgeous home! Thank you very much John for the great accommodations for our vacation!! 100/100!","Boston"

She accommodated my last minute request, made check-in super easy, and had beautiful touches to the very very clean room which made things very nice (chocolates, water, etc).

The bed was comfortable but be aware that both the left side and bottom of the bed are close to the wall so it is awkward for a couple getting in and out of the bed. Linens were clean.","Boston"

Linda was on hand whenever we needed her to answer any of our questions. We were made to feel very welcome and Linda's house felt like home from home. It was very conveniently situated for a short walk to local amenities and when travelling into Boston centre the public transport was easily accessed and convenient to use.

I loved that the condo is in this quaint and historic residential neighborhood.  Little Italy's restaurants are right at your door step.  Everything is as advertised here.  It has all the modern, luxury condo amenities and even a private roof deck.  It was a perfect location for my stay during Boston Marathon weekend.  A great space to relax and unwind, while also near all the marathon events and Boston attractions.  Caroline was the consummate and thoughtful host.  She checked in to ensure I had everything I needed and even offered me a rain jacket when the weather turned inclement.  I highly recommend Caroline's condo and hope to return here on future visits.","Boston"

And I will warn you the pictures listed were really incorrect. The room had a lot flaws like doors that didn’t open, Door locks were loose, toilet seat needs to be replaced and parking was terrible. I spoke to the point of contact and she said find a spot that’s residential, a parking lot that was not close or just pay the $40 fine since it is the same price as parking. Well the parking ticket was actually $60 which I received. Overall the unit needs some remodeling for the prices being asked and I would not stay or recommend.","Boston"

Wi-Fi and cable worked perfectly without fail for the entirety of the stay. In the spring/summer/fall, this would be a great place to visit for an out of town guest.

CONS: During our stay in January, the unit did not have working heat. Using the provided space heaters caused the circuits to trip, which required frequent trips to the fuse-box to reset. The shower also did not heat up to a comfortable level. We had some difficulty getting in touch with Caroline during our stay.","Boston"

Just to clarify the checkin process as it was not 100% clear to me before hands. There is a lock box nearby for the keys, but the building (particularly the next door neighbor!) asks some one to escort guests quietly into the building for the initial checkin at least. As a result and understandably, the owner wanted to have an accurate estimate of the arrival time. This could be a little inconvenient if you may have other plans in mind before checkin. Another thing to keep in mind is that make sure you don't forget your belongings, as it won't be so easy to get them mailed if you are from out of town.","Boston"

As the description says there are 5 flights of stairs to get to the apartment so you will get your stair master in.
As we drove to Boston, parking was a bit of an issue.  As we had an SUV, street or cheap alley parking was not an option.  We used the Center Plaza garage which worked just fine, and was $90 for 4 days reserved via SpotHero.","Boston"

Location is central - you can walk anywhere

Reasonably priced
The view - could see the Prudential and John Handcock buildings 
high ceilings 

Cons: 
Felt like a hotel - managed by a corporation - I was fully aware of the non refundable policy but I booked the wrong dates and less than 40 minutes later they refused to refund or change.
-cleaner entered the room without knocking (I was unclothed). He then kept the door opened as he verified my check- out date!
- tiny, but adequate, bathroom that lacked anyplace to put - well anything! Had to place toothbrush, toothpaste, razor etc on the counter in another room!
-noisy - Newbury Street is busy at night 
-furniture a bit beat-up. Nightstand looked like it was used for target practice","Boston"

The apartment was a really great use of space (the bed in the ceiling was very cool - and comfortable!). The kitchen and all the furnishings were very high end. 

I had a bit of trouble getting in - the key to the front entrance of the building would not turn in the lock. I could not reach the housekeeper, but when I reached Michelle at 10:00pm on a Monday evening, she and her husband drove from their home (an hour away!)  to ensure I got in. THAT is customer service!  (Especially because it turned out that the key DID work, it was just a bit temperamental.)

She arranged for the cleaning of my room early so that I could check in before 9 am as soon as I arrived from an overnight flight. I was able to sleep before my conference started at 1 pm.

The weather was getting cold, so I asked her if she could turn on the heat and it was done the next day. She also replaced the airbed with a new one when it broke.

My two complaints were the lighting in the room wasn't very bright, making it difficult to do anything that required a bright light.

It could get very annoying at some points when they were continually walking back and forth for hours, especially during the early morning when I was trying to get as much sleep as possible before work.","Boston"

We were on the third floor so we didn’t have a great view like the pictures and the construction and traffic was extremely loud. The apartment was spacious with high ceilings which were beautiful. We had a very rough first night. The second bedroom was very small  and hot. We could find no way to get it cool. We slept maybe 2 hours and were miserable. We called bluebird and they contacted maintenance to come deal with the shower that wasn’t draining and the a/c unit. They came later that day and we realized that it was not working because they had put a dresser blocking a thermostat in the room and the unit.

The apartment itself had everything we needed, and we were tempted to just stay there all day on one of the rainy days. Also, the shower is awesome, I wish I could take the water pressure back home with me! Getting in was very easy, and so was leaving. The place was very clean, and the bed was very comfy.

Be warned though, the whole place reeks of incense. Some people love incense, others don't. I personally fall in the middle. Had I had the option, I would've asked the host to not have any incense smell in the apartment.

The HUGE problem with my stay is that on the very first night, one of the alarms went off which emitted an incredibly annoying chirping sound every 15-20 seconds or so.  I think it was the carbon monoxide alarm. Regardless, I guess it's not the hosts fault that it went off.  What IS her fault is that it was not resolved (even though she said she would have maintenance come the next day to fix it). So that's  TWO nights without sleep.

This is now being handled by Airbnb and I expect fully to receive my money back.

If you stay at this place, make sure that she can ensure that this alarm won't be going off in the future. And if it does, that at the very least she gets it turned off.","Boston"

It is not beautiful, but quite ok and things work (the bathroom, the kitchen). The air conditioning is noisy and rather ineffective. The main bed is comfortable, the couch not quite. There is no way to make (real) coffee and no mug to pour something hot. The place is quiet, but if one wants to stay during the day, it may get depressing: the two windows look at walls and fire stairs (with some restaurant fumes). Overall: good location and ok for the price, but less than marvelous.","Boston"

Corey's thoughtful touches of little notes around the apartment, some snacks and drinks for us, and supplies for the washer & dryer made sure we felt very much at home during our stay.  It was just a few minutes walk to Bunker Hill, the USS Constitution and several great eateries, and not much further to the Old North Church and the North End.

If you prefer a firmer pillow, there are extras in the closet. The town home is about a 5-7 minute walk to the blue line. Very close to the airport. Lyft ride was about $6. You can also take the Shuttle or the blue line to/from the airport. With Lyft, we arrived downtown in 15-20 minutes.

Neighborhood is pretty quiet.

It will be hard to concider staying in a hotel room next time not just because of the better value AirBnB usually offers you but also because very special experience of living as locals!","Boston"

"262",14538087,329377627,2018-09-28,6549229,"Alexis","Jay is great. He is responsive and was available via messaging for questions and needs during our stay. The North End of Boston is also a wonderful and vibrant place. We loved being able to walk out our front door to visit the restaurants and see the lively street. 

The unit and building itself do need some work. But it’s also an old neighborhood so I get that for the charm you have to put up with other inconveniences sometimes. 

If you’re younger and don’t mind noise later in to the evening then book away! I was traveling with my husband, our daughter (10 months) and my mother in law. The general set up of the unit worked well for us, but it was noisy. It does note this a bit in the description and I understand I should have heeded the mention a bit more. But the front bedroom is literally right next to the entry door for the building. Unfortunately the building door closes very loudly and the front bedroom window is not sound proof so you can hear it. If you were renting with fewer people and only going to use the back bedroom then the door closing is much quieter. 

The building is also comprised of people in their 20s. Which does let you know the area is hip, but the crowd was definitely loud in to be night, which didn’t fit our stay. If you’re headed to Boston looking for night life and staying out late (like 1:00/2:00 am) then this wouldn’t bother you. Or maybe you’d meet the neighbors and hang too! 

Again, Jay is great as well as the North End. But this building didn’t hit our marks.","Boston"

I arrived at 7pm to painting and some remodeling still being done and had to wait.  The door was very difficult to lock and unlock.  There was no hand soap which would have been nice.  It's a fun neighborhood and the view of the city skyline from the porch was great!  Host communication was not as great as it could have been.

"282",17611122,250929410,2018-04-06,172304929,"Chrys","Ricardo was easy to reach via the app, but is not on the premises. Because of that, there is no one at the home to enforce any of the rules. This became a problem at night, during the so-called “quiet” hours, when people were talking very loudly and slamming doors. On top of that, the walls are paper thin, and where we were staying, in room #8, we were right next to the road so every person and car that went by was very audible. Also, the front door has no latch, and every little breeze would slam it against the door frame, which was also very disturbing throughout the night.

The room itself was about the size of a walk-in closet. The bed, while a decent size, is just a mattress on a makeshift rig of plywood and other material. This caused it to sink and tip depending on where you were on it, which was very uncomfortable. On the subject of the bed, we did find some stray hairs and whatnot in the sheets as we tried to go to bed.

In the amenities for the listing of room #8, it listed a television, which I took to mean that there was one in the room. There was not. There is one very small (maybe 10 inch?) monitor in the common area, and that was all I could find.

One of the main reasons I chose this location was that it offered parking, which is hard to find in Boston. Unfortunately I did not notice that the parking space on the property was littered with glass, and so when I went to leave I found that I had a flat tire, and had to drive back home several hundred miles on the spare.

I ended up leaving 2 days early from this stay because of the problems I had. I asked that Ricardo refund not even half of what I payed to stay there (and not counting the tire) and he refused, and further said that the tire was not his responsibility, despite the fact that it happened on his property, in the spot that he offers with the room. So, be prepared for the possibility that, as soon as you raise your voice about a problem, that the host at this location will just as soon wash himself of any responsibility for the problems you may have on his property.

The proximity to the train was nice.","Boston"

Alexa was very responsive before I arrived and helpful upon check-in. I was so busy that I hardly saw her throughout my stay. But she did provide detailed information about the room (rules, amenities, etc,) and contact phone numbers if I had an issue. The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet, with a couple of restaurants and shops within a short walking distance. It is an older neighborhood, so there is very limited parking on the streets.  I used car services through my trip, so I didn't have any issues","Boston"

Easy check-in and going in and out of the house during our stay. We were out of the house all day so we really needed just a place to sleep and access to a bathroom. If we had anything to critique on our stay, it would probably be the mattress. It was a bit too firm for our liking but other than that, the house itself was very beautiful.","Boston"

It is a short walk to the Public Market, the North End (fantastic restaurants!), and to Roche Bros. for food shopping.  Plus there are great restaurants right next door to the place.  It is very quiet, and the laundry on the floor is convenient.  The only down side is that there is no AC in the bedroom, not even a fan, only a window unit in the den.   We were there when it was 90 F outside and opening the windows at night did not establish any breeze.  My wife has hot flashes and we had to sleep on the sofa bed in the den, which was not a problem (it was actually more comfortable than the bed), other than making it up and putting it away each day.  We did a late checkout due to a late afternoon flight back, and Anne allowed us to leave the bags in the room until we left.","Boston"

Check-in directions were straightforward and clear. The owner/manager responded quickly to a small issue with the cable TV and fot it sorted out. 

My only small complaint is that, one night there was a lot of very noisy truck traffic outside the building in the middle of the night. Possibly garbage trucks or other delivery trucks. Even though the apartment is on the 8th floor, the windows are not soundproof and I did wake up repeatedly. It only happened one of the nights I was there.  Could have been an unusual situation. 

I’d definitely stay here again. Just might bring some earplugs with me.","Boston"

Very close to the Orange T line. Place needs some blankets and pillows for the trundle bed. Price seems just a bit high for the location which lowers the overall value a little. This is primarily due to the cleaning fee. The $100 cleaning fee is high. I live in a 2500 square foot home in the Bay Area of CA and I pay $110.

So I was a little put off that the door to my room would not close entirely and therefore would not lock. There is no knob on the door either so as I slept the door just blew open. The door needs to be trimmed to fit the frame and a knob needs to be installed. The overall look of the place is shabby and there is the obvious lack of attention to guest privacy and security. While the listing claims the house is close to ""pubs cafés restaurants groceries shops"" I do not believe that is the case. The only thing I could find for morning coffee was a restaurant a half a mile away. I did not see a grocery or market. 

Positives: The bed is extremely comfortable and the linens were clean. A fan kept the room cool and the neighborhood is quiet and pleasant. It is very, very close to public transportation, and a large park and running/walking trail along the water.","Boston"

The tv and WiFi were iffy at times but nothing horribly noticeable. Only about a 10-15 minute walk to restaurants, train stations or bus stations. Walls are a bit thin and the shared bathroom window is in direct view of the neighbors, but shower had great pressure and temperature. Would definitely recommend staying here.","Boston"

Everything was very clean, which is a big thing for me when traveling. 

I booked their “no frills 3 bedroom” Airbnb for the PAX convention at the Boston convention center and it was EXACTLY what I was looking for. It was only a 5-10 minute uber ride from the center back to the Airbnb. It’s also only 15 minutes away from Quincy market and newbury Street, which is a very popular shopping center. 

To give an example of the space, it fit 4 people very comfortably. The table in the kitchen sat 4, tv area sat 2 on the couch and 2 on the floor. 

Great experience, I would definitely book again at any of Jordan’s locations and would highly recommend them to anyone looking in the Boston area!","Boston"

The stairs to the rooms are very steep, curving and small - just be aware and know it takes some effort to get a suitcase up them.

Had never been to Boston before, so I was at the mercy of the internet in ferreting out a neighborhood to stay in, as well as a place.   Luckily, I hit the jackpot, on both counts--this is a terrific place, steps away from trendy restaurants, coffee bars, transportation, all tucked away in a cozy courtyard in Beacon Hill, which is a pretty happening part of town.  Cobblestone streets, gas streetlamps, stylish brownstones--one almost expected to hear the clip clop of a hansom carriage bustling by.  The place itself is put together with a decorator's eye--attractive furnishings and artwork, super clean, top notch accessories for cooking, if one is so inclined (we weren't--too many great restaurants to sample), plenty of hot water for showers along with thick and thirsty towels, wi-fi,...on and on.  When we walked in the place, my wife and I both said ""We could LIVE here!""  Literally, you could walk out the door, and be enjoying your first glass of Chianti at Antonio's--the delicious Italian bistro just a few steps away--within about ninety seconds.  And, Jim was first rate at communication--quick to answer his phone or an email.  We can't wait to return: Boston, Beacon Hill, and Jim's place all get an A plus on our airbnb scorecard!  (A tip for those who look for the place on (Hidden by Airbnb) maps, your Uber driver, etc.: for some reason, 0 Strong Place refuses to appear, so I used the address for Antonio's, which is 288 Cambridge St--it'll get you exactly where you need to be.)

The residents around there are so friendly. There is a beach just 5 minutes of a walk away too with a playground.

The problem is with the bedrooms, which is not at par with the living room, not by a long shot. The master bathroom is in a pretty sad state with holes in the wall and a shower door that barefly functions, and let me not forget there is a desk lamp perched on top of the vanity lights. There is a TV in the master bedroom but is not hooked up to any cable box or antenna.  In pne of the bedrooms the bed is 1/3 in the closet and your cloths would literally be hanging over your head when you sleep. Pray for sturdy hangers. The service was awful. I go there 2am in the morning and there was no key in the lockbox. Had to wake the host just to get in. There were 3 of us in a 3 bedroom unit, and we didn’t get 3 keys until the day before we left. There was no towel in the master bedroom, so I had to go find towels around the house 2am after checking in. The water heater closet and the laundry room seem like fire hazards waiting to happen, with a propane tank by the laundry machine and rags underneath the water heater. The location is great and that’s about the only thing good about this place. Will not rent again.","Boston"

It's a small flight of stairs up from street level.  The living room windows looks out over Franklin Part, which was beautiful under a fresh snowfall.  The place had everything advertised:  It was spacious, with three good-size bedrooms, a fully-functional kitchen (which we used) and kitchen table, and everything was spotlessly clean.  It's an old house, but everything worked.  

Elliot was a pleasure to deal with.  The entrance instructions were clear.  Elliot was very responsive.  And one very nice touch:  My car was parked at the end of long driveway next to the hours.  It snowed several inches over night.  By the time I woke up that morning, Elliot had shoveled the driveway so I had no trouble getting my car out.  Stuff like that really counts in my book.","Boston"

Walk-up brownstone in a neighborhood of brownstones with restaurants nearby (I wasn't able to try any due to other commitments).  Very prompt communication from the hosts, very detailed and accurate instructions on how to enter, follow-up to ensure everything was to my satisfaction.  It very much was.  I only slept here due to a busy schedule, but the couch was comfortable, the kitchen was clean and seemed very functional, the bathroom was immaculate with decent water pressure, etc.  I'll definitely be staying again.

Note - it's less than 1/2 mile walk from where the Logan Express bus drops off and picks up at Copley Square so extremely easy to access.","Boston"

His list local recommendations were spot on! We enjoyed the Atlantic Fish Co, Tatte just down the street was a staple each morning, as well as Toscano. 

We loved the furnishings (the beds and linens are incredibly comfortable) as much as we did the location. Beacon Hill is so incredibly beautiful in any season and taking short walks around the neighborhood each day was an added delight. There's much to explore from the hill, to Boston Commons, to Newberry St, to the Freedom Trail, and the North End, making this the perfect location. 

We'd stay again in a heartbeat! (Oh, I don't think it's mentioned on the site, but there is a pack n' play available which was very welcomed. We brought our bassinet conversion and was perfectly compatible).","Boston"

"561",1147871,282178310,2018-06-26,45660757,"Betsy","We looked forward to the convenience of Izzy & Cesar's place near the Boston Airport. When we arrived, however, we had a hard time following their directions . The hour then got late, and we found ourselves lugging our suitcases while trudging the 7 or so blocks from the shuttle drop-off past piles of trash, including broken chairs and discarded mattresses set out for trash pick-up the next day. I had not been warned about safety getting to the house and was quite unprepared for a very scary and long walk. The house was also not clearly marked. We let ourselves in easily with the key code but opened the door to smell lingering odors probably left by an incontinent dog at some point in the home's recent history. We lugged our suitcases up the steep, sticky stairs, and found that the overhead light didn't work. Then we discovered what was meant by ""shared bath"": that we would be sharing one downstairs bathroom with the hosts and anyone else staying in any of the three other guest rooms.  One old bathroom for 5 bedrooms!The shower and tub were mildewed and dirty. Tiles were cracked. Towels were ok. The sink was cracked and old. Thankfully, the window air conditioner in the room worked. In the morning, the coffeemaker did not work. Cesar and Izzy are organized: signs with directions appear throughout the house, including a request to remove our shoes before ascending the sticky stairs. They have decorated some areas creatively, but much remains to be done. After coming from an Air BnB where we had paid exactly the same as we did for Cesar & Izzy's place but encountered first class service and concern for our safety and comfort, we were quite disappointed. Had I been alone, I would have forfeited the payment and found a hotel. What single person could be confident of her safety in a place with strangers in each of four other bedrooms with old hollow-core doors despite flimsy locks? What about guests allergic to mold? I hope Cesar & Izzy are able to make the changes needed to succeed because they seem to want to do host many folks.","Boston"

Wonderful amenities (small full functioning kitchen, strong wifi, and tv), location, and feeling of living in beautiful Beacon Hill. Walking distance to everything and a little market just a few steps away. Checking-in and checking-out was a breeze. Emily is also prompted to respond.

I do say that upon entering the building, there is a strong bad dog/cat odor like how it smells in an animal shelter. Not because of Emily or studio's fault. This is mostly likely caused by another tenant living in the lower part of the building. I did have to hold my breathe a few times when entering and exiting the building. But, you don't smell it as much when you get to the room. Also, as days pass, you don't notice it as much.

But all the other great things about this place would make want me to stay here again and recommend the place to others.

Thanks!","Boston"

First when we arrived our bedroom was occupied for a family that got there earlier and was offered our bedroom by “mistake”. The host talked to them and they move, nothing was cleaned by the hosts after they left.
Secondly and more important, the place looks great in pictures, very clean and nice but it is nothing similar to that in reality. The coffee machine was smelly and we had to clean it before using it. The whole place was dusty, I don’t think the rooms are cleaned correctly before the new guests arrive. Finally the entrance to the house is so messy, it doesn’t take a lot to clean the house and make it look like a clean place. In general, the place is nothin like it looks in the pictures.
The host was nice, but the place is not. If you are willing to sacrifice one for the other, this is your kind of place.","Boston"

Right by the State House at the start of the Freedom Trail, and easy walking distance to different neighborhoods and the subway system.

"633",27729451,331748134,2018-10-03,140280081,"Brittany","I loved staying here much more than I expected, as did my boyfriend. To start, the location is amazing. We walked pretty much everywhere, and we’re from Texas so that isn’t really something we typically do. The aquarium is a 15 minute walk, the science museum is a 30 minute walk & Boston Common is also about a 30 minute walk. Of course you can take the T or uber, but this is just for reference (and we chose to walk unless the weather was too bad). Also, food is EVERYWHERE around you here. There is also a cvs really close by, which is super convenient. Additionally, the apartment itself was well furnished & decorated nicely. It feels nice to sit on the couch and watch Netflix after a super long day of walking & doing tourist activities, which is exactly what we did. Overall, this is all more than enough to get me to like a place BUT Beth & Dave made it even better. They recommended restaurants before we even made it to Boston, recommend us taking the water taxi in instead of a normal cab/uber (which was incredible) & checked to make sure we made it okay. They were super welcoming & even invited us to a celebration they were having while we were there. 

To sum it up if you don’t wanna read all of that: the location is great, the apartment is cozy, there’s food everywhere, the hosts are very nice. My boyfriend & I both really enjoyed our stay & said we would stay here again if we ever go back to Boston.","Boston"

The restaurants on the block were very good as well (Dunkin' Donuts, Fill-a-Buster, and Grotto). We walked to most places we wanted to go or took the subway. No need for a car if staying in downtown area.

The room itself was nice and quiet, sunny and bright. The TV had many channels and there was free wifi which is always appreciated. The bathroom was clean and nicely updated, which is so important. It can be difficult to find bathrooms in Boston, which again makes this location excellent.

Though we didn't use the laundry in the basement or the iron/board, it was good to know they were accessible.

The stairs, though beautiful, were rough for me on arrival being I had a large suitcase and my room was on the third floor. But I made it. 

I would go stay there and recommend this space for one or two people.","Boston"

Because of the delay, we arrived at the apartment at 11 o'clock in the evening, and we had to catch the plane at 5:30 in the morning. In this very short time, we had very bad experience .I feel a strong pungent smell when I entered the door. Even worse, because it is near the airport, it was psychologically prepared for aircraft noise.Unexpectedly, the house is also close to the subway, and in about ten minutes there will be a very loud voice of the subway. It probably lasts until 1am.
The smell is more unbearable than noise. I used my perfume to no avail. We had a painful night. At 5:30 the next morning, we fled the apartment.","Boston"

The room was beautiful and clean, and had ample amenities such as tea/coffee makers, and various other food stuffs for the guests in the common area. Everything you need - they had it! Bill and Maureen even cooked cakes and cookies for us! Doesn’t get better than that! Plus it’s only a short bus ride to the South Station T.

If you’re a light sleeper, better bring earplugs.  Plus each morning we were there (3), a car alarm went off at 5:30 am.

All in, we probably saved $35/night over a comparable hotel room.

The space has enough room for 3-4 people to stay, and it has enough bedding supplies. Unlike other host sending checkin instructions ahead of time, this host didn’t tell me any information until I asked the day of checkin at 2AM, but she did reply right away. She is very responsive. There is no toothbrush or tooth paste in the room, so you might want to prepare for that. The other thing is the noise problem, in the morning, you can hear from the car noise from the street and people taking next door, that can be bothersome. Overall, it’s a great place for friends’s gateway, we voted 7/10, just because we expected a little bit more for that price range.","Boston"

The circular staircase might be a concern for people with mobility problems or families with little kids, but it only makes the apartment cooler in my opinion.

The neighbourhood is working class but a great opportunity to experience another side of Boston.The accommodation is about 10 minutes away from the station by foot and there is supermarket next door to the station. For independent travellers it is an easy trip into the city. The accommodation was very comfortable and well suited for two couples travelling together. The kitchen living area was spacious and well appointed and we cooked dinner easily. There are two flights of fairly steep stairs inside the house but easily managed if you are reasonably mobile.There is no upmarket restaurants close but plenty of fast food outlets.The hosts were wonderful and went out of their way to give advice, organise a taxi ride to the rail station and were quick in responding to any needs.","Boston"

The location has the benefits of being away from the bustle of town, in that it’s quiet, but is only a short ride away from the main city. Because of the location and the extensive public transit system, we didn’t need to use any ride sharing. 

Corey kept the house and shared bathroom clean. He cleaned the bathroom several times a day and provided fresh towels and bath mats. The bed was comfortable and also clean. I had no concerns about cleanliness and I am very picky about that. The only downside is the creaky floor, but it is a historic house after all. 

He had a fully stocked fridge of drinks and snacks available to us. He also had a range of options for breakfast out every morning, from pastries, cereal and toast to yogurt and granola. 

Corey and Bill were very welcoming and were glad to share suggestions for places to visit. He had a variety of pamphlets we could look at for ideas on where to go and Corey also gave us many good suggestions. And they even had umbrellas we could use when it was rainy out. 

Overall, wonderful hosts and great location.","Boston"

This is just a part of someone’s house that they have blocked off with small tables in front of the doors leading to different parts of the house. The interior SMELLS and creeks anywhere you walk. So when they ask you to “be quiet” it’s impossible. Also, I’m on vacation and booked an “entire place”, so I should not have to limit myself because your listing is inaccurate. There was also NO AC in the main part of the apartment/bathroom. The only ac was a small window unit in the bedrooms. 

I had another coworker stay 1 night because his hotel booked his dates incorrectly, and we had PLENTY of
Beds. Well I get a message that it will be $100 extra for that one night and extra person. Keep in mind there were only 2 people in the home. THEN our key code to the apartment was apparently given out because someone was in our apartment while we were out for the day. We know this because the mail was missing off the table.

"948",12957423,312063499,2018-08-22,5061761,"Robin","We and our teenage daughter had a pleasant two-night stay in Jame's home.

The location is fantastic: right in the middle of the North End of Boston, within easy walking distance of basically everything.

There's no parking on site, so we parked in a pay lot a few blocks away, near the historic Copp's Hill Burying Ground. Cost was about $30 a day. The walk to the apartment was short, and took us right past the cemetery and Old North Church. We had to climb Copp's Hill, which is pretty steep. It wasn't a problem for us, but if mobility is an issue, you might want to find a different parking lot.

Access was easy: key in a lockbox opened a gate into the apartment building, and the apartment door is just past the gate.

The apartment is pretty small -- bedroom, bathroom, and a kitchen/living room combo that is somewhat tight -- but it's well-maintained, nicely furnished and comfortable. We easily slept three people, two in the bedroom and one on a fold-out bed in the living room. 

It's a ground-floor apartment, but it's a couple of feet higher than street level. That means the street-facing window is about 6 feet off the ground from the street side, so people aren't looking in at you as they walk past. At night it was quiet and we had no trouble sleeping.

One thing that wasn't within easy walking distance was a real grocery store. Monica's Mercato is right at the end of the block, but it's more of a deli than a grocery. If you plan to eat at home during your stay, I'd recommend arriving with your groceries.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay and thought it was pretty great value for being able to stay right in the North End. It more-or-less exactly matched our expectations.","Boston"

The cottage was built in 1910, so it has some quirky features (which I kind of liked — it quickly grows on you).  The cottage was clean and everything worked.  The kitchen was well stocked, and had everything you would need if you wanted to cook a meal.  Bill was a great host and offered a lot of information about the Boston area.  Unless you want to drive up/down the coast, I would suggest to not rent a car and take transit, uber, lyft instead (uber and lyft are swarming around the city).

Across the street was a convenience store which came in handy for last minute miscellaneous items and snacks. The apartment we stayed in was on the first floor. There are 2 more apartments, one on the second floor and one on the third. The only issue we had, although not so much the fault of our host, was that the tenants renting the third floor locked themselves out and for 20 minutes they abruptly pounded on our front door, back door, and bedroom (Website hidden by Airbnb) was 4am. The host however was kind enough to reach out to us the following morning and apologized on their behalf. We were a party of 9, and we fit very comfortably.

Iris’ place is clean and convenient to everything we wanted to see in Boston.  Ate out all meals so we did not use the kitchen much. There is street noise but after walking all day, it was not noticeable at bedtime once you lie down  on the very comfortable bed and sofa bed. We did not venture out after dark so I can’t comment on the nightlife. The Thinking Cup coffee shop is a block away and it’s great for breakfast and after dinner coffee.  Boston Common is across the street and there’s an information booth where you can buy tickets for tours. A very good experience at Iris’ place.","Boston"

We walked to most of our destinations and used Uber when we needed a lift.  Nero's coffee house is 25 steps around the corner and there are several other restaurants (one with nightly live music - Beehive) within 2-3 blocks.  The house was very, very clean and found the bed to be most comfy.  Chris was very accomodating with our late arrival and quick to respond to our questions.  The shared bath is not an issue as you are sharing it with Chris and not other tenants.  Highly recommended and we defintely would stay at Chris's again!  Enjoy life, Jim","Boston"

You could easily cook your meals here, but why, when there are so many good restaurants nearby.

Two spacious bedrooms and a very large kitchen. Honestly nicer than our own apartment! I would especially recommend staying 
here if you're traveling with family or a friend since you can comfortably fit two couples. I was with my wife, her mother, and our 7 month old son and we had plenty of room.

The place is super easy to reach with public transportation (the red t-line) as we didn’t have a car. The stop is 5 min walk from the house. Hermina’s house borders on the local police station’s parking lot - it doesn’t get any safer than that! The neighborhood is very diverse with lots of vietnamese stores and restaurants. Visit the nearby Homestead Bakery for great coffee and baked goods in a relaxed atmosphere! Hermine was great with giving tips for close by eating places. She is very friendly and hospitable and wants to make sure you have a good time during your stay.
If you happen to be a runner, the Dorchester Bay is only about 1 mile away and and awesome place for a run as long as you want it. 
There is one full bathroom and one powder room for all guests, so in the morning there will be a wait for the shower. The common spaces are nice, including a patio with a table and chairs, lovely to sit outside if you bring or make your own food.  
Thank you, Hermina!

Hosts were extremely friendly and helpful and quick to respond via text. They let us drop off our bags earlier than the stated check in time so we could go to the Fenway area. The bed is in a common area with 2 bedrooms on each side and the bathroom right there as well. No privacy for your bed and the bathroom was kinda gross were the only downfalls. But being a 10 minute walking distance from Fenway for $60 was worth it. I would rather have a friendly and welcoming host with a grimy bathroom than vise versa.

"1076",20673030,302538239,2018-08-05,16056997,"Emily","The description didn't mention that the listing is located in a basement.
It was HOT and HUMID with no fan available for air movement and virtually no windows that could be opened because they lacked screens.
There were no towels in the kitchen.
The listing advertises off-street parking, but none was offered or evident.
The dogs are LOUD when they run around upstairs.
The refrigerator makes a strange, nearly constant barking noise. The TV is too big for the space and things are generally cramped because there's too much furniture in the apartment. 
The steps up/down between rooms are hazardous and should be marked with brightly colored tape as a warning.
For a couple, this listing might be okay (provided there's a way to cool the place down), but it's not suitable for more than two people because there is a complete lack of privacy between rooms.
As a guest, I found it unacceptable that Yashin didn't respond to our request for a fan, which occured only a few minutes after we checked in. The next day, 30 minutes before check-out, he stated that he didn't have his phone when I'd written, which is ludicrous. As a host, he should be able to be reached if his guests need something. This was a wholly unsatisfying experience, with each member of my party getting only a few hours of sleep (including my young son) because it was so uncomfortably hot in the apartment. This is my first unsavory AirBnB stay, and I hope it will be my last. Save yourself the trouble and stay somewhere decent instead.","Boston"

The only cons about the apartment: the upstairs noise at morning time and the noise of neighbors doing laundry since the laundry room is located next to the apartment entrance.
The only thing about the location is that there is no T station nearby , and I am not familiar with the bus sistem so I had to take uber many times to get to other areas of the city since it was too cold for long walks..

The house also comes with a list of rules which is understandable, but the tone that is implied with the rules is a little insulting and arrogant. In the list of rules, Hilary threatens that she will charge a security deposit of $ (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) if rules are broken numerous times throughout. The home is her primary residence and we felt like her unwelcome paying guests. There is a one car garage in the house which she is adamant that is not to be used and we were instructed to park on the street, which was difficult. The area was described as a quaint village with bars and restaurants within walking distance, which isn't true. There is a star supermarket across the street and a pizza place about a five minute walk and a Dunkin' Donuts, but I would not walk around this neighborhood at night. The area is at the beginning stages of gentrification. It may be quaint in a few years but is nowhere near there yet. I regret not researching the neighborhood and looking on (Hidden by Airbnb) images prior to my trip, as I wouldn't have chose this home to stay in. I would recommend (Hidden by Airbnb) mapping the location and viewing the street Hillary is on prior to booking.","Boston"

You can get anywhere easily from this location.  Public transportation just steps away. Easy to walk to many stores and restaurants. Nice little kitchen, well stocked with lots, pans, dishes etc. Plenty of hot water in clean bathroom. The basement apartment is easily accessed via the parking lot in the back, which was just steps away from the apartment.  Three caveats. This place can be hard to find in the dark. My suggestion would be to scout it out during daylight. Fortunately, there was a neighbor who assisted us. And the mattress is super, super, super soft. And the stairs are narrow and windy. Not for the ages knees. But as I said,  the back entrance compensated for that. All in all, a very good place to stay. Especially for the location, cleanliness and parking.","Boston"

Stay in his AirBnB if you want to get to know the locals, grab a beer in one of the bars close by. Get good bagels and coffee at the Sugar Bowl Cafe nearby, meet the neighbors.
You won't regret it. 
The room is tiny, so if you're not traveling alone, definitely book one of the bigger ones. For me it was perfect and the price of the room was more than fair. Red Line trains are give minutes away and go into the city center in under 20 minutes and directly to MIT, Harvard etc. A large supermarket is in convenient walking distance, so are convenience stores.

The House and Room: the House was beautiful and the front room is so inviting with books, the newspaper, and TREATS! Steve and Laura made sure to put out treats, (sometimes fresh baked!) with wine and the newspaper. The place was easy to find, exactly as they said, their directions are very clear and accurate so be sure to read it over. My husband and I stayed in the smaller room with the Murphy bed. It was absolutely perfect for us. The decor was really clean and stylish and integrated Boston maps and activities. There was a Nespresso machine in the bedroom so i didn’t miss a kitchen at all. The bathroom was fully updated and the shower head was amazing. 
The Hosts: Laura and Steve were so kind, helpful, and great hosts. They came out to greet us while we were hanging out in the backyard. It was really nice of them to come visit. They both responded within minutes when contacted.

the only knock on the place was a noticeable cigarette smoke smell when I arrived. I'm not sure if the previous guests broke the rules and smoked in the unit or if it's more long-standing.  The hosts were very responsive when I let them know and even brought in an ionizing machine to help clear the air. That was pretty amazing!

If you're particularly bothered by cigarette smoke, however, you should be aware. Hopefully they're able to clear that up quickly. Given how responsive and responsible they were, I'm sure they'll be able to take care of it.","Boston"

This place had steps into it, in case you have members that would have trouble with them.

The only mirrors are in the bathroom.  There are no closets or hangers.  The stairs are not symmetrical.   The rise and run are different on each step, and there is no handrail.  Three nights the people above us had parties that kept us awake until after 2 a.m.!!  There are plenty of towels, perhaps a bit short on hand towels.  The iron and ironing board were nonexistent.  The outside trash had not been picked up in quite awhile.  It was overflowing, and we did find a rat when taking out a bag. 

With six bedrooms and 8 beds, we all had plenty of room.","Boston"

Location was amazing-- right by Boston Common and was very close to everything we wanted to visit (North End / Freedom Trail, Charles River Esplanade, Chinatown, etc.). There were many cafes and a CVS around the corner-- very convenient. 
Check-in / out process was extremely simple with the instructions provided. Apt was clean and had everything we needed. We were pleasantly surprised by the amount of amenities provided.
Like the description says, apt has a street-level-facing window, and it can get pretty noisy with the hustle and bustle of Charles St. so it might be a bit much for light-sleepers.

Each host is different, Toma likes to know about you before your stay and has good detailed description how to check-in and out using his management service on email, so a few extra steps than usual but nothing too arduous.

We were awakened a few times because of the traffic noise from the street below, but we expected that as other visitors mentioned it. I would suggest bringing some ear plugs.

I would highly recommend staying here for your trip to Boston!","Boston"

Experience and I don’t wish it upon anyone else to experience this. The apartment I was faced by upon my arrival was disgustingly dirty and unsanitary. The apartment had not been properly cleaned in a long time
It looked like and not cleaned after the previous guest. I was met by layers of dust, filthy floors, unvacuumed carpets, food leftovers in the kitchen, hair in the bathroom, thick layers of mold
In the bathroom and overall an enormous disappointment.  A cleaning team came
To take care of it day 2, but the service was so superficial
It did not so much to the unsanitary conditions. After the first week the situation went
from
Bad to terrible when maggots was discovered in the kitchen, they were in our food, cabinets, countertops and they where crawling up along the walls and ceiling. I reported all these incidents to the Airbnb support team and received LITTLE TO no refund. I am
appalled by this situation and that I had to live in dirt, mold and maggots infestations for 2 week. No recommendations whatsoever for anyone to book this place. Stay away.","Boston"

The apartment looks like it was recently updated, but some additional construction clean up could be done and more attention to thorough cleaning would be great. The beds were very comfortable and WiFi was perfect!  Appliances were updated.  The apartment was small, but cute.  Additional seating in the living area would be nice, as the couch will only fit 4.  It would be crowded, if you had 6 people in the apartment, but for 4 it was ok, for a short visit.  It is about 20 minutes or so from the center of Boston, but Uber is readily available in the area.

The overall experience of what we were looking for including those outside of the AirBnB as well as the kitchen/table was great especially to eat breakfast & snacks and the living room was what we wanted with a place that we could plan our day and reminisce at night on the great day we had! Plus, Jay's communication was excellent! In addition, the security was great – took a little bit to understand the locks but once we personalized it into the unit, it went very smoothly from there! This was the 1st time for all of us at an AirBnB so we were looking forward to it. We've traveled frequently nationally & internationally including a number of places that were ~$500/night including the Four Seasons in Boston, the Ritz Carlton and more. Plus, we’ve all stayed in B&Bs and love the type of ambiance that would be somewhat similar to an AirBnB (e.g.: staying in someone’s home). I would love to give rave reviews especially since I’ve been in marketing & sales for 25+ years and know how much excellent feedback means. Unfortunately a number of things came up that while our group went back & forth on if we should share with Jay, we decided we should because if he chooses to implement them then the experience can be better for others. Can’t emphasize enough that we’re “not complainers/have camped in sleeping bags on the ground” but felt that too many things arose that hopefully he'll take this feedback as it’s intended-nothing against him as a person but rather specifics on the place especially for ~$500/night. The 3 main topics are: Uncomfortable bed in the smaller room, cleanliness in multiple places & temperature. First, we had 2 different experiences with the bed – the King in the master was just fine – while we sleep on a tempurpedic at home and wouldn’t expect that, we felt it was what was expected. The Queen bed in the smaller room was quite uncomfortable where it sagged a bit in the middle and the padding on top was only 2 inches thick and was askew on the bed so it was very difficult to move it over so it’d be even on the bed. The people who slept in there were very uncomfortable for the first night and resulted in needing to put a folded sheet in the middle to try to balance it out – helped some but the consensus was it was definitely time for a new mattress. Second, unfortunately there were a number of places where it was truly dirty that primarily included the hallway bathroom including black hair on the ceiling in the shower and encrusted toothpaste & hair in the drawer plus, the gray area rug in the living room had hair in it. Third, the temperature was very difficult to manage. We all have wall...","Boston"

Being only seconds from Newbury Street was great for food and shopping! If you are bringing a car, you’ll need to look into parking garages. All the surrounding streets are for residents only.

The apartment was perfect, plenty of room, clean and in a great neighborhood!  Parking was tough but Domio told me about an app to find parking and we found a parking lot a couple of blocks away.

The apartment itself was clean and spacious with great accents. The kitchen was well stocked with basic items such as pans and pots and a variety of different spices. The bedrooms were clean and came with pillows and comforters. 
The location of the apartment was fantastic! About a 10 min walk to Wholefoods, CVS, and the Orange Line (to take you to the heart of Boston, downtown crossing, and to any of the other MBTA lines), along with other great restaurants nearby. There are tons of parks nearby as well if you wanted to just walk around the area. There is a local school close by that has a great track as well (for those to enjoy a morning jog). Another great highlight was parking: the apartment had its own designed spot for parking (no street parking for us!). 
Our trip to Boston was great thanks to Max and his gorgeous apartment. We will be sure to come back! Thank you for sharing your home with me and my siblings!","Boston"

Even when our expected 4pm arrival became 8 pm, Carla never expressed any frustration, and was still there to personally welcome us. The home has enough space for 6 to stay without feeling cramped, so for 3 it was like being at home. I loved that everyone could have their own room. The kitchen was well stocked, and there’s a great dining table- it’d be a great place to bring a family or just a group of people, and cook if you didn’t want to eat out every night. 2 Bedrooms on the second floor means that people can stay up late without disturbing others. And the towels . I cannot overstate that everything was perfect, including the neighborhood. There’s a great restaurant named Veevee’s literally a block away that even pleased my notoriously picky eater mother. On a students budget I won’t be able to come back as often as I want to (every weekend), but I’ll be back again with friends for sure. Thanks again, Carla!","Boston"

I had to cancel one night of reservation (within 24 hours of checking in) due to inclement weather issues. Konstantinos allowed me to cancel without any issues and I was reimbursed for that night. He also offered a late check-out to me since he wasn't coming back till the evening. His instructions are clear and gave great restaurant recommendations too. 

Like other guests have mention, the main draw of Konstantinos's place is the location in the North End. It's very convenient to all the wonderful restaurants and touristy sites. However, the walls are very thin. I heard the neighbors vacuuming, slamming doors, etc. and of course the general city noise outside. I was out and about most of the time so it didn't bother me too much. Also, the apartment is on the 4th floor (no elevator) so not ideal for the elderly or people with heavy luggage.  Overall, I would book Konstantinos's apartment again when I'm in town.","Boston"

1) It’s right across from a T stop so transportation is easy.
2) The neighborhood hasn’t been fully gentrified (yet) so people’s reviews about a sketchy neighborhood probably should have just said don’t be an idiot at night.
3) It’s an old house in South Boston so don’t make the mistake I did - keep your food in the fridge so a mouse doesn’t eat it.
4) The bed is so soft it’s nearly a black hole, but that’s fine if you like soft mattresses.
5) The bathroom isn’t cleaned every day, so its cleanliness depends on the other guests.","Boston"

Apartment is the ideal size for two and has all the necessary amenities. Bed is very comfortable, shower is clean (remember to bring your own toileteries!) and kitchen is functional.

A few more dishes and towels so you don’t have to wash dishes and towels do frequency. If choose not to have extra pls leave more dish washer and washer detergent. Also an extra pillows would be nice

The apartment is in a great location, centrally located to virtually everything in Boston.  About a 25min cab ride (20$-25$) from Logan Airport.  Deanna was a great host, she contacted us to establish a check in time, there were clear instructions written out regarding the area and apartment details.  Make sure to bring toiletries, coffee and tea.  The apartment probably could have used a paint job and a bit of updating, but the value you were getting for the price was totally worth it.  Having the added benefit of the concierge at the front desk was a nice add on for extra security. Clean apartment.  I would go back.","Boston"
"1447",14870402,325408103,2018-09-19,35967086,"Amanda","This is a perfectly fine apartment to stay in, clean, and the description and photos are generally accurate. The host is pretty hands-off - I didn't receive any personal messages, and they won't meet you, but you have to walk down the street to an alleyway to pick up the keys from a lock box. Many people won't mind this, but just be advised, especially if you're arriving at night because it felt a little shady. Also, be prepared to bring or buy your own toiletries. We found dish detergent, two conditioner bottles, and a tiny amount of liquid hand soap (as in, a container that was practically empty). There was no shampoo, body wash or bar soap. From other reviews it sounds like the toiletries are hit or miss and not replaced regularly. The place is pretty small: the bath and bed themselves are normal size but there is not much extra room to move in the bathroom or bedroom; the sofa is pretty small but the main living/kitchen/dining space is an okay size for two (it's kind of a studio apartment) and we appreciated the TV with streaming apps. The location is okay, pretty far from most central tourist attractions if that's what you're interested in, I would say your public transportation options are moderately convenient, and this is a college area full of students. They all seem like serious, well-behaved students, not partiers, but still a lot more young people than not. The neighbors seemed pretty quiet although there was work being done on the apartment above us for an entire day which was extremely loud, and there is some street chatter at night. We paid a higher price than what we originally clicked on (that's Airbnb for you), in general I would say this was an average (not terrible and not superb) Airbnb experience, I'm not sure if it's worth the high price unless it's the best price you can find or if you're particularly interested in this neighborhood.","Boston"

Lots of restaurants (Panera, P.F.Chang, Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Shaking Crab, etc.) within 3 blocks. This unit has a view of the RIVER (through skyscrapers) and is lovely, on the top floor of the building (with elevator!). The management company is super responsive, and we had a great stay.  PARKING is another matter.  There is an EXPENSIVE garage across the street ($20 for 5am-5pm, $15 for 5pm-5am = $35/24 hr day.)  There is very LITTLE street parking (most reserved for commercial vehicles), so we ended up paying for the garage.  It was cheaper for us to buy a month pass in the garage so we could come and go and not be charged for every exit.  You can walk right out the door to the Freedom Trail! Oh, and the bed was very comfortable - supportively firm, with foam on top - ""just right"".","Boston"

It is walkable to Newbury and wonderful dinner/drinks/coffee shops. The place is managed by a third party organization and not by the host directly, which unfortunately was a but of a struggle as we arrived to note that some things were missing or broken and it took a bit of extra communication to get in touch with the third party and have them fix things. Ultimately, they were responsive to changing the heat (they have to change it remotely, you cannot change it yourself), and came to fix the toilet even while it was snowing (very kind of them), and did re-stock the missing items (TP, PT). Otherwise, the place was a cute, well-insulated spot, with hot water, comfortable beds, perfectly adequate for most everything that we needed. Note that they are clear upfront that the kitchen is not stocked so if you want something (coffee etc.) you will just need to pick some up, which was not a problem for us. The rooftop nook looked like it would be lovely if it were not snowing and this would be a great spot in the summer =)","Boston"

The area where the apartment is ok; it is South Boston after all so it's a bit more rough and ready than other areas and not somewhere to go exploring in the evenings.

Alex & Kat's apartment was small, but super cute, clean and in the perfect location that allowed us to walk to tons of places. (Berkley Performance Center, where my daughter and I saw the Black Violin group was only 5 minutes from the apartment!) There are tons of yummy eating places within walking distance... Phoe Basil was amazing, Mr. Bartley's Burger Cottage was great and Max Brenners Chocolate Bar was super yummy! All of these places were within walking distance to the apartment. :) The apartment is located on a side street, which normally is probably quiet, but while we were there they were doing construction on the sidewalks right outside our apartment. We had the best spring break trip and would definitely stay again at Alex & Kat's place.","Boston"

However, I was provided the wrong address of the apartment and had to request it a couple of times before I was let in.  Not a huge deal and was figured out.  Bigger issue was the sound of the people upstairs.  This is an old building and if you're a light sleeper, maybe not the best option.  There was a family of 5 - 6 people upstairs stomping around at 5:15am and I could physically feel the vibrations in my bed.  They then called a taxi and were screaming outside.  2 of the 3 rooms are facing the street, on the 1st floor.  The windows could really use some soundproof updating as I had to open the window to tell them to be quiet.  Lastly, I tried to extend late check out from 11am to 12pm.  Owner never responded.","Boston"

We were 3 and it was a tight fit, but we managed. We wanted to change dates more than 3 months beforehand due to one of us having an unplanned event. It took him almost two months to answer. When we contacted him about the wifi, we never got an answer. The place is probably not professionally cleaned which is why it still has dust in every corner and strays hairs here and there. The bathroom is definitely the dirtiest and you wouldn't want to take a bath in that tub. You might actually want to bring flip-flops to wear in there to take a shower. You could hear everything happening outside and the AC was really loud.  Also, the airbnb is not at the exact address provided by airbnb, but it's still close to it, so you might want to double check before heading there.","Boston"

Buying 7 days pass commuter trains, busses and subway included in price. Very comfortable bed, free coffee, tea and water provided. Other guests were a a bit trashy and loudy, so a lot of hairs were everywhere in bathroom and breadcrumbs in every corner in kitchen. Kitchen is really nice, with all supplies with you might need, even with ice maker integrated in the fridge. Very smooth check in, no problems at all. I really recommend this place.","Boston"

Negatives: the outer sheets on the bed had stains on them, but main complaint is the heat. The house had no heat so walking to the bathroom upstairs and being in the bathroom was cold, and we were here during 50-60 degree weather. The bedroom had a space heater the size of a shoe box for a large bedroom and it was pretty insufficient.

We were forced into re-booking an Airbnb last minute and settled here, but it appeared there were much better options in this price range when we originally booked a place in Boston many weeks prior. We wouldn’t stay again.","Boston"

Es ist alles selbsterklärend durch die freundlichen Schilder, die überall im Haus aufgehängt sind. Check-In lief reibungslos ab. Das Haus ist recht hellhörig, was aber nicht weiter ein Problem war, da sich alle Gäste respektvoll verhielten (außerdem gab es kostenlose Oropax). Es gibt kostenlose Snacks und Getränke, ein großes Plus. Frühstück gibt es allerdings nicht (Airbnb zeigt das falsch an). Parken ist in der Gegend sehr schwierig, aber am Flughafen kann man für 26 Dollar für 24 Stunden im Economy Parking sein Auto im Parkhaus abstellen - von dort läuft man ca 15 min zum Airbnb. Zur nächsten Ubahn Station sind es gute 10 Minuten.

There’s also a pool on the mezzanine, which I would have loved to check out if we had more time. The space itself was clean, and instructions were very clear, detailed, and thorough.

The apartment was decorated nicely and Drew was a very attentive host asking how the apartment was in the first few days of the stay.  I appreciated all the tourist information that was available so I could figure out what to visit on my off time from the convention.

Les choses ont commencées à être plus difficile le matin, un douchequi fonctionne très très mal, c'est eau froide ou eau brûlante (charlie m'a dit qu'il s'en occuperait rapidement mais je ne suis pas resté assez longtemps)
La seconde nuit à été epouvantable, énormément de bruit (ma chambre est collée au couloir et a une porte entourée de jour donnant dessus, bruit et lumiere) que ce soit venant de la rue, les digicodes (un à l'entrée de l'appart un autre pour la chambre) des que quelqu'un entre où bien les voisins peu soucieux de la tranquilite de l'immeuble.
Ce n'est pas chez l'habitant mais un appartement comprenant 5 chambres (sont l'une est une pièce commune munie d'un lit) 
Ça ressemble plus à une auberge de jeunesse qu'à un airBnB chaleureux, je suis reparti fatigué et déçu de cette expérience...

The host: Jim is a graceful and welcoming host. He kept good communication until our arrival, received us, carried my luggage up two flights of stairs, gave us a tour and tips of the apartment, had maps of Boston, and had cold coke and snacks waiting for us. We had an issue with the unit (see below) and although he could not resolve it, he took the time to discuss it with us, and agreed to change the unit description for future tenants. The unit: This apartment is located steps from the T red line, very easy to get there from the airport and anywhere else. Amazing grill right on the corner, and a very well stocked gas station for any last minute craving (they carry many groceries, ice cream, even organic and gluten free) Two flights of stairs, it is described in the unit, it's no joke. Stairs are well lit if you arrive at night. I knew about the stairs and they were no issue for us. The unit is exquisitely decorated to reflect Boston, that's the best I can describe it. Old charm, but it doesn't feel old, it feels homey. The unit is an attic apartment, and as such, the ceiling is very low closer to the walls. I am 5'5 and I bumped my head a few times. Beds are nice, two pillows per person, sheets, blanket, closet space to hang clothes and dresser. Only two towels in the shower, for two people 6 nights is a bit of a stretch specially for those of us with long hair. No hand towels, only one small (and thin) cloth (seems to be a kitchen cloth). There is a very useful night light. Generous bottles of toiletries (body wash, etc... can't comment on quality since we brought our own due to allergies).- By the way, my son has allergies to dust and mold, and neither one of those flared during the trip. That speaks highly of the place-. There is no shower curtain so water will splash out and it will be slippery. There is a rug, but water splashed past that. Jim had left a floor towel for the entrance so we used that to dry it. Shower drain is 1mm above the floor level, so there will be a puddle. There is a squeegee there, I didn't realize what it was for until day two where I stepped on slimy water. Good idea to include in the initial instructions tour. Kitchen utensils seemed well stocked, we only did breakfast there since it was too hot to cook any other time (see below) The main issue we had with the unit, is that being an attic unit, it gets really hot. If you've ever been in an attic on a sunny day, you know what I'm talking about. It gets much hotter than the rest of the house because...","Boston"

This is a neat little place, easy to prepare your own meals.  There is a stair climb, and being an older building, they are narrow (not a problem for me).  The apartment is tucked into a courtyard, so you are out of the mainstream noise in the North End... no worries about disturbances.  I truly enjoyed my stay.  One disappointment was the laundry.  The washer can be set for no less than 55 minutes and the dryer is useless, even though it was supposedly repaired.  There are two laundromats with wash and fold service within walking distance.","Boston"

There is also plenty of parking - we were able to park right outside the house every day without any difficulties.

Paige’s apartment it is truly on an amazing and safe block so, in this regard, it totally satisfied our expectations. We were just a bit disappointed because they pictures were much, much better than the actual place and for what it costs we expected a nicer ambience. Just an older apartment with totally basic rooms, window ac units into two of the three bedrooms. nothing bad about it but not as fancy and modern as it looks like in pictures. The deck it’s practically impossible to enjoy as it’s super hard to get to through ripid steps.

Unit itself: Pretty outdated for what the pictures show, Some updates need to be done. You can see where they have tried to address some cosmetic concerns throughout but in a quick fix fashion. Trim around master bedroom, replaced but looks awful, bathroom door had extreme gashes in it, needs to completely be replaced. Beds were extremely comfortable. 
Host: had some minor small things that needed to be addressed, but they handled them quickly. Needed more pillows and blanket and they actually went out and bought brand new ones and left at the unit. 
Overall: We were really only in the unit to sleep, so I can't complain much. Pictures just make the unit look a little nicer than it actually is. Location was perfect and space was tight for our group of 8 but worked out good. If you are looking for a great location, and are okay with some minor cosmetic issues, then this is a great place to rest your head.","Boston"

Host tried to help by texting but nothing got better. The heating system does not work properly and are very noisy, especially at night. The windows are drafty and you can feel the cold breeze entering the room. The residence is essentially under a basement and you may only enter from the back door which is where the Garbage Bins are. The reasons are listed in a guide(which is thousands words long) given to the guests before check-in: the neighbors dislike residents who checked-in through Airbnb, which confuses me because if your neighbors hate so much about the fact of hosting residents via Airbnb, then why bother.","Boston"

I don't think it has to be mentioned that this is a basement apartment, so don't be expecting a panoramic view of the Boston skyline.  However, the lighting was great, it was cool and comfortable, the kitchen was well above average, there was a nice entertainment center, and there was plenty of space.  Most of the airbnb rentals in Boston tend to be upper floors, so it was nice to be at ground level for a change.  Off street parking is a nice bonus with a short walk to the door.  The surrounding neighborhood was nice too, with a short walk to a dog park and nice restaurants and cafes. I was visiting MIT and it was only about a 20 min drive away.  As other reviewers have said, you can hear some foot traffic from the floor above, but it was brief and I didn't find it any problem.  Since the apartment is on the back of the house, there was no street noise at all.  Would definitely stay here again.","Boston"

The house is very small and Fati has some very strict rules for quietness and respect for anyone staying there as noted in a previous review.  It is her house and she can make the rules to follow,  not hard to do actually.  The bedroom you stay in is large enough and clean.  There was thankfully an AC in the room,  a bedside lamp with no lightbulb in and the cord wrapped around the base, a red light digital clock with the wrong time on it (off by hours).  The common area downstairs was very cluttered, not conducive to hang out there. Be aware that Fati sleeps on the sofa in the common area,  I just found that startling when I  came in at night and heard breathing in the living room as I passed through.  
It is roughly 3/4 mile walk from the T stop.  Not a bad place to stay but just be aware of the circumstances , as it is quite affordable.","Boston"

It’s also in the perfect location—just a few minutes walk away from the Freedom Trail, great restaurants, and downtown Boston (and there’s a Whole Foods right around the corner). And above all, Jonathan’s hospitality went above and beyond—he left us a warm welcome note, some local food treats, had the kitchen stocked with healthy breakfast food, and was very helpful in offering restaurant recommendations and the best way to get to/from the airport. Would 100% stay at Jonathan’s again, and highly recommend you do too!","Boston"

Secondly, he makes his space your home while you are there.....beautiful rooms, a wonderful bed and the best shower of our month-long US trip. We couldn’t wait to get “home” each night.

I never talked to them over the phone nor met them in person, and there was no need either. The apartment was super clean throughout, updated and pretty. The bedroom is spacious and the bed comfortable (for my taste). The bathroom is a bit small but overall OK. The kitchen has granite countertops, new appliances, including a dishwasher. There were water bottles and sodas in the fridge. The living room furniture is nice and in good condition. The heating is good both in the living room and the bedroom. As others have noted, the building’s common areas, hallways, carpet, are pretty run down, and unpleasant. You also hear all the street noises loud and clear inside the apartment, although I wonder if this would be improved if/when they remove a temporary window AC in the living room and that window can be closed all the way. The noises didn’t bother me much, as I’m not a light sleeper, and they’re to be expected to an extent when staying right in the city. The other residents of the building were quiet during the weekend of my stay, so no complaints there. The location is very convenient especially if your activities will be focused in the Back Bay area. I uber’ed to and from the apartment every time so I can’t share how it feels to walk around the block. It would have been great if it had been a tad less expensive but lodging in this area is clearly crazy $$$$ in general. It was significantly cheaper than the hotel alternatives in the Back Bay, which during the days of my stay started at $350/night + tax. The apartment came out to a bit under $300 / night. I would definitely stay here again.","Boston"

In planning, you might want to realize that two of the bedrooms have just a stair and curtain between them so are not fully private.

The location is fantastic...less than half a mile on foot from most of the things we wanted to see, and two blocks from the orange line from things further afield. There is a Whoke Foods three blocks away, too. We were traveling with a couple and two kids and found it accommodates us nicely. There is a huge walk-in closet that tucked all the bags and clothes piles away so that we always had a tidy apartment to come home to. Steve and Drew provided tons of recommendations and made check in easy. Our summer visit demanded air conditioning, so we were glad for the units in the apartment. We were really pleased with our experience.","Boston"

"1790",20148844,285407077,2018-07-03,4306116,"Christy","This is a great space especially for larger families that needs more room than a tiny hotel room! The 2 rooms are large and spacious with comfortable beds. There is also a nice spacious living room and kitchen area that worked well for our almost 2 year old to run around in. The rooms also have plenty of space for pack and plays for the kids. The apartment is on the second floor so there are stairs to navigate so that can be a challenge with bags or strollers, but not too bad. There is a market and bakery right across the street and a couple of restaurants right up the road. The T station is literally just a couple of blocks and thru a cute park with splash pad during the summer. Two stops to get into main part of city (Aquarium) for tons of things to see and do. We also loved the convenience of getting to and from the airport. There is a shuttle bus that picks up and drops off each terminal at the T station and then just a short walk to the apartment. The apartment has all the amenities needed for a great stay including a washer and dryer, dishwasher, plates, cups, cooking items, and even seasonings and spices and things in the cabinets and fridge. There are also box fans in the closet if it gets too hot. This is a great option to stay for those needing extra space and convenience to the city!","Boston"

The fridge & pantry came stocked with grocery staples — eggs, milk, cereal, orange juice, paper goods. It was awesome not having to grocery shop when we arrived!  The subway was a short walk away, and the Public Garden was only a few short blocks. The space was modern and tasteful.  Plenty of shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Even a laundry washer & dryer with detergent.  It felt like a hotel, just without the daily maid service.  I would definitely stay here again.","Boston"

Sonder provided soap in the bathroom, clean towels, and plenty of toilet paper was a plus! We were close to everything we had hoped to visit, great location in downtown Boston. While being on the first floor was a plus, it definitely came along with the various noises Boston has to offer in addition to hearing the main door to the building slam frequently. If you're a light sleeper I definitely do not recommend. Otherwise, highly recommended!","Boston"

The condition of the shower in the master bedroom was unacceptable because paint would drip/fall on you while you were using it, the door to one of the two other rooms had a very obvious hole in it, the wifi for our unit never worked and didn't match what we were supplied in the welcome message anyway(but luckily we were able to use a different network from a near by unit), and all of the rooms really needed some better privacy curtains. It was uncomfortable changing in the rooms because they were small and every apartment across from us could see everything we were doing.","Boston"

I got invthe habit of starting my day with a nice walk through it. Other easy access walks include Back Bay and the Freedom Trail. The one thing about Billy’s is the lack of an elevator which he informed me about ahead of time. If your conditioning is fine, it’ll be no problem climbing the stairs.","Boston"

We had a wonderful lunch at KO Pies, and loved the neighborhood cider brewery!  Great location! Thanks again!","Boston"

If you are a Red Sox fan and heading to a game, this unit has everything you need.  An easy 10 minute stroll to Fenway and you are there.  Being able to see the iconic Citgo Sign from the master bedroom was an added treat for this third generation Red Sox fan.  Parking in the back of the apartment building was easy and convenient.  After we unloaded the car on the street side, we parked the car for the three days as we explored Boston.  The unit is exactly as described and Jodie and Steve make it very clear that the bathroom and kitchen are small.  They and the pictures are telling the truth so be prepared for that.  For our family this unit was exactly what we needed.  next time I just hope the Red Sox win their game!","Boston"

"1808",4402259,295943364,2018-07-24,177702094,"Chris","Caitlyn's apartment is a great place to consider staying at when visiting Boston. My son and I stayed there for five nights, and it was plenty of room for us even though it's only a studio apartment. She was very responsive in communicating with me, provided some breakfast items for us (bagels, cream cheese, cold brew coffee, etc), had a nice welcome letter on the table (directions to places, eating suggestions, WiFi info, etc), offered bathroom items (shampoo, soap, towels, etc), and checked in with us to make sure everything was going well. We enjoyed sitting outside on her private patio, exploring the local Charlestown neighborhood, and watching TV on her couch at night after a long/exhausting day of exploring Boston on foot. The only negative remark I can provide is something Caitlyn has no control over, and it involves the loud footsteps from her neighbor just above her apartment. It honestly didn't bother me as much as it probably should have, and it did not negatively impact my stay there. I would highly recommend staying here because she has a lovely apartment, she was an excellent host, and the location was perfect for us. Don't hesitate and put in your reservation with her!  =)","Boston"

You cannot beat the price to location ratio here.  We walked to a ton of locations around the area, enjoying some beers at Corner Tavern and other places.

J was very quick to check us in which is always a plus to me.  I'm typically tired from traveling and hate overly talkative hosts.  

There were two beds included and had a good deal of privacy between the two despite being eye view of each other.  She also gave us plenty of towels and pillows, although the pillows were a bit flat.  Easy entry and easy close out too.","Boston"

The apartment is extremely stylish is decor, and everything you could possibly need is included. They have pots, pans, a Keurig, and of course plates, silverware, etc. They have cable, so you can keep up on all your shows, or you can watch Netflix, Hulu, or any other streaming network your heart desires.

The patio is AMAZING! I was in town for a week for a marketing conference, and let me tell you how nice this patio was for getting work done. When you’re cooped up all day in a convention center, being able to sit outside is the best feeling ever. And I didn’t even have to change out of my sweatpants!

The neighbor upstairs is a little noisy, but that’s out of their control, and honestly didn’t affect my experience enough for me to give them anything less than 5 stars.

Do yourself a favor, and stay here when you’re in town!","Boston"

Our arrival flight was cancelled then terrbily delayed and thankfully Joe provided a lock box with the key for self check in at 3:30 AM!! During our 6 day stay, we took a morning 1/2 mile walk downhill to the Fairmont commuter rail  stop for a 20 minute $2.25 ride into Boston's South Station, where you can walk 15-20 minutes to Chinatown and start of Freedom trail, or Faneuil Hall area or harbor area. You can even go around the corner to do the $31.00  Ciityview hop and on bus tour after purchasing your ticket at the gift shop. Each evening after a full day of exploring we opted to catch a uber back which cost an average of $20-$30 for uber x. (Uber pool would have been 1/2 the price.) It was much more convienent and cost effective than a rental car, gas, sitting in traffic and paying $40-50 for daily parking. We did rent a car the last day of our stay in Dedham and then explored New Hampshire, Maine, Vermont and Rhode Island the following day before returning the car to the airport to catch our flight home. We didn't use the microwave or refrigerator, but there was one available. We did take advantage of the coffee maker and coffee provided to enjoy coffee every morning before we headed out for the day. Check the rail schedule daily as there was one day it wasn't running and after waiting for over an hour, we had to call an uber.  We never used the rail to return at night due to it's location under a bridge  and the uphill walk back with my mobility issues. Thank you for Joe and Patrice, we were able to stay in Boston longer to enjoy Fenway, Freedom Trail over 3 days, Harbor, breweries, disc golf, Eateries, and surrounding States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode Island!! This is a great  place to stay with your own private entrance and bathroom.","Boston"

The location was about 5-10 minute walk from the station to get you downtown, which was very convenient. We had our own bedroom to ourselves with clean towels every time we needed to shower. Expect to be staying with the family of three but was no problem for my boyfriend and I. We get our own access to television and a Apple T.V. in the bedroom which was a nice touch. A a/c unit is placed into one of the windows and another window open for fresh air. The apartment was in a relatively nice neighborhood and our host was very pleasant. She even sent us a list of recommendations of things to do for first time Boston goers. Stacy's was very quick to respond. I'd definitely recommend staying here! P.S.

Never had this at an Airbnb! The place looks beautiful and was just 2 walking minutes away from the subway station (but you never hear it). The neighberhood is clean, safe and quite.

It's a very safe area of the city, and incredibly centrally located--great if you are planning on getting places by foot or public transit. (I cannot speak on parking as I don't have a car). This place is ideal for a lone wanderer or a couple, as it's rather small, as advertised. And, if you aren't able to scramble up a ladder, it's not ideal for you.

That being said, it should probably not have been rented. The only real long-term problem I can see is that it said it was air conditioned. There was one window unit in a bedroom. The rest of the home was over 90 degrees. I am sure all of this was known. There weren't even any questions when I left a day early even though it was paid for. I guess most of the year in Boston it is alright, but it is August and people should be informed so they can make their own decision.

We were supposed to stay in a smaller apartment at another location but Inn Boston had over booked that place.  They apologized and upgraded us to this apartment which was a nice surprise to have the second bedroom.  The location was very nice with easy access to the Boston subway system or a pleasant but longer walk to some sights,  and plenty of lighting on the streets at night.  The apartment itself was very clean and spacious.  Some of the decor and furniture were a bit drab but nothing that affected the overall functionality or comfort (example, the couch cushions are worn and fading in some spots but it's still comfy).

He went out of his way to make sure that I would be comfortable during the hot, humid days of summer. And he’s ceaseless in his desire to improve host experiences; he even had a full length bedroom mirror installed after one of our casual chats (though there were sufficiently other mirrors already)!

There’s only a chain to keep the main door closed, no real lock so ur securely safe. Beds are awful and un comfortable. Random run down pieces of furniture in the place. Constant noise from cars and train always going by so you won’t sleep here at all. Bedding was itchy and thin.  Charged a cleaning fee and it was clearly not thoroughly cleaned black hairs all over tub and toilet couldn’t even shower due to no hot water. Kitchen was gross and floor has chipped tile so it pops out if u step on it. No bowls spoons etc. for $164 you can get a way better hotel. Chaotic finding the right door to where the keys go to, and even than the keys wouldn’t go into the lock first four times we tried. Just very run down and pictures don’t show any of that.

Right near a grocery store, liquor store, and the T station, which made it easy to budget if necessary.

We were able to either walk or take a short Uber ride to everywhere we wanted to go around the city. The apartment was, in our opinion, an exposed basement, however that didn’t bother us too much. We didn’t end up spending much time there as we were busy exploring the city. Overall we had a great stay and would recommend Julia and her apartment to anyone looking for a convenient place to stay in Boston!","Boston"

Downsides: Not a lot of space to unpack your suitcase, cleaning could be a bit better.

The apartment is very clean, the kitchen is modern, and the apartment is well stocked with needed travel amenities -- linens, toiletries, and simple breakfast foods. Although not in the heart of the trendiest neighborhoods of Boston, the apartment is within minutes of restaurants in the north end, historic neighborhoods, and other tourist destinations, and is also within minutes of 2 or 3 different metro stops.","Boston"

A couple times my wife and I turned on the heat and the temperature in the apartment actually went down.  Granted, they were some of the coldest days on record but it felt like cold air was coming out.  I never mentioned it to the landlord so can't really complain.  The place is also ideal for public transportation.  Right across the street from Boston Common and the Green line which was great.  The Orange line was only a block away also.

Near parks, shops, tourist attractions, restaurants.  Everything within walking distance.  The place is a very good size - large living room and kitchen and two very good size bedrooms.  3 adults and a toddler fit very nicely, with lots of room to spare.  There are 3 air conditioners in the place, but on hot days it was still warm inside.  One tip is to close the bathroom door because most of the heat comes in through the skylight in the bathroom.  A few other things to be aware of which is part of being in the city are the following:  Before I visited I had read reviews about the noise from the nearby busy road.  That was not an issue at all; however, expect that at least one car alarm will go off every morning between 6:30-8am.  We opened up our door one morning to find a car parked less than 2 feet from the entrance which made getting in and out of the place with a toddler a bit challenging.  We later learned that the space outside the front door is a parking spot that someone owns.  We continually spotted an ant or two, but Kama was great in that she dropped off some ant traps the next day.  Overall though a nice spot to stay.","Boston"

Check-in was completely seemless and the host made herself easily  available for contact the whole weekend, checking everything was good on our second day of the stay.

I reached out to Brenna who responded immediately and was able to accommodate the necessary changes to our stay. Brenna’s place was neat and comfortable (and warm!). There were breakfast bars and coffee for breakfast. The kitchen had basic essentials such as cups, utensils, and plates. There is also a refrigerator for food storage if needed. Brenna’s place was within walking distance to the Hynes convention center and it was  a short walk to the nearest T (subway/train station). I would recommend Brenna’s place to any future Boston traveler.","Boston"

She is very attentive and friendly; so is her family. I had the pleasure of staying with them for three nights and I wouldn't have had it any other way. The historic house is beautiful and spacious. Donalyn is extremely accommodating and has amazing communication skills. In the morning she prepares a nice breakfast for everyone and you definitely don't want to miss out on this- it's delicious!  

The bed is extremely comfortable, I almost didn't want to leave at all hahaha. 
Staying at Donalyn's place is an amazing experience because not only do you get to meet an amazing family, you also get to interact with other guests if you so choose. Even if you are an introvert, like I am, you will enjoy chatting with your host and other travelers.

As far as location, the house is located about two miles from Ashmont train station; it's an easy walk. There are also various bus stops and a commuter rail station a few blocks away. 

I will definitely stay at Donalyn's again the next time I am in Boston.","Boston"

The neighborhood is ideal and close to small and large shops. Excellent service and location!!....The reason for the 4 stars is that it’s very hard to get a good night sleep in the studio for two reasons. The bed is positioned immediately under the window. This means that you hear everyone and everything outside. 
Additionally, the window shade is paper thin and white. This means that all ambient light from the street lights and skyscrapers outside makes the apartment look like the day time at 3:30 am. I brought ear plugs and an eye mask and was still woken up (and kept up) by noise and light.","Boston"

The only downside was that we had to walk up and down a relatively steep and narrow staircase every time we needed to leave / enter the house, as the entire living area was raised a floor above the street level, which could be a bit inconvenient.

The unit was on the 7th floor and quiet. However, we experienced a couple of glitches. The first and most major for us was that parking is tough. There is a garage, at $36/day - with the billing going from 5 a.m. to 5 a.m. Which means if you arrive at 10 p.m., like we did, you'll pay $36 to park from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., with the clock starting anew at 5 a.m.  There is 2-hour parking on the street but you need to keep feeding the meter, or moving your car around. We also had an issue with there being no towels in the unit when we arrived.  Sonder said they'd bring them the next morning but wound up delivering them that night, catching us in our pjs, but ok, we need towels! Last snafu of our only-2-night stay was the key fobs to unlock the unit door stopped working and we had to wait for someone to come diagnose and fix the problem - a few hours. Sonder did respond to texts quickly and seemed interested in helping us fix our problems. But at these rates, I really didn't expect to have these kinds of problems.","Boston"

One thing to keep in mind is that they are doing a lot of work to improve the place. Micah was over pretty much every morning making coffee for everyone, and generally just hearing suggestions and feedback (he's a really fascinating character, and I strongly suggest getting to know him if you're inclined.)

The one complaint, which I talked to Micah about, and it is in the process of getting fixed, so it likely won't be there when you want to stay. The front door and the floor fit a bit too snugly together, and could be a real pain in the @$$ to open. The other thing to note is that this isn't the best neighborhood. But honestly, the very affordable price should be a clue. Nothing happened, but if you are one who is particular, this might not be the best spot for you.

Other than that, the hostel-like atmosphere was amazing. Met some phenomenal people in the 4 nights that I stayed. Some from Brazil, Holland, Poland, and Texas. Very fun place. I'm excited to see how it evolves. Would definitely stay here again when I visit Boston. Thank you Micah!","Boston"

I could get ready to go out leisurely after my shower without feeling I was spending too much time in the bathroom!  Also enjoyed the  ""three minute"" walk to the West Roxbury Commuter Rail that took only 20 minutes to get into South Station Boston. (*****you have to purchase your tickets on the train in West Roxbury so don't look for a station). Walking distance to a great Chinese food store, grocery store, pub, etc.  You could spend a day just hanging out in the neighbourhood if you wanted a more relaxing day than Boston could offer.  Nothing seemed to be overlooked.  We were only two of us there for a week so never used the dishwasher or the washer or dryer so can't speak to their function.  Thank you John for a great stay!

The check in instructions were very clear and everything went smoothly!! 

The apartment itself was a great space. The basic pots and pans and utensils were available. A nice bonus is onsite coin laundry right outside our entry and complimentary detergent under the kitchen sink!  I brought my own camp chairs and we enjoyed sitting out in the back patio- not many places in that area have a patio available.  It was convenient to bring our belongings around the back rather than up and down the stairs in the main entrance. 

Again I would like to emphasize the roominess and cleanliness of this apartment. This is a great value for your dollars!! The host responded promptly to any and all inquiries and all instructions were very clear!  We will come again!!","Boston"

Commute into town very easy - 20 mins on Fairmount commuter line (dont believe the internet, this line needs a different ticket to the Charlie card, managed a free ride due to our ignorance, which was a bonus). If going the longer route, or to Boston Fine Art museum, you'll want a Charlie card for the bus/train combo or cash in change, no larger notes (another bonus free ride here, again our ignorance but free rides by no means guaranteed) The museum is excellent, the most beautiful I've ever been to. 
The house itself is large and comfy, good pressure in the shower and lots of hot water. Key code and door easy to use and Kathy gave good directions. Bus stops and train station all very near.
Small row of shops nearby and we received warm and enthusiastic welcomes at fish and chip shop and smaller newsagent which was wonderful and made us feel right at home.","Boston"

The place had very dingy carpeting and only one freestanding air-condition unit. I booked it even though it was overpriced because it was close to the airport.

However we didn’t enjoy our stay as much as expected because the apartment isn’t as clean as mentioned by other reviews. Floor was dusty, linens are all very worn out and stained. There are loose air vent covers, and are very filthy, I’m constantly making sure that my kids do not touch them. WiFi is spotty, tv is outdated and small. Mattress is very hard and when my husband moves in the middle of night, we hear some loose springs and get woken up. Pillows need replaced. All mattresses and pillows need to be replaced. I woke up with strained neck and back. there’s a  Chair in dining room that’s broken and is a hazard to young children (my kids are 4&6. Neighborhood is not safe either - we witnessed a group of people fighting in the streets, chasing each other with baseball bats and yelling when we were getting out of an uber outside the apartment on our first night. We had to cover our kids ears and get inside ASAP. In addition, the front porch door needs replace for security reason and the main apartment door has 2 locks but only one is functional.

The place had very interesting books to read and cable so we weren’t bored. There are restaurants and a Whole Foods that’s walking distance which I mentioned to the host that I wanted to buy wine at Whole Foods. He informed me that they don’t sell alcohol there and sent a bottle of wine to my door! The host was very attentive and gave great advice on where to go.

As many other guests mentioned, Jacqui's attention to all the little details makes her place feel very comfortable and homey.  We ate at a breakfast/lunch place close by and were very pleased with her recommendation.  The walk to the nearest T station was a bit further than expected, but not a bad trek.  We lucked out and had beautiful sunny warm weather, so that made the walk just fine.  The bathroom has a low ceiling and stays hot and humid after showering.  There is a fan in the corner, which helped to cool off.  Jacqui is an excellent hostess....the perfect balance between friendly attentiveness and respecting your privacy.  Her affordable rates for the location, plus free designated off street parking, make this an ideal spot for a short visit.  We hope to visit again soon.

Other than that, I would totally recommend this place. I will definitely return to this Airbnb when I come back to Boston.","Boston"

The place was very clean and is in a good location to get to downtown Boston easily. While I Uber’ed most of my way around, I did use the subway once which is only a 10 minute walk from the place & the subway was VERY easy to navigate. I recommend parking on a street by the place because paid parking can become very expensive around there and you’ll be fine if you just make sure the street sweeper isn’t going by there at all (they have signs). I highly recommend taking a walk up Lamson street right next to the place. There’s a park up there will you’ll see lots of dogs & if you keep going further you’ll eventually get to the East Boston harbor which gives you an AMAZING view of Downtown Boston. Overall, I had an amazing two days in Boston and if I ever come back I’ll be sure to book this place again!","Boston"

It's easily walkable to Hynes convention center (about 8 minutes), and a good location in general. Everything was clean. Street noise is very audible but that didn't really bother me. As some reviewers noted there are steps.
Based on past Airbnb experiences, I would have liked more personable hospitality. The hosts are very business-like. No one could meet me when I arrived at 10pm. The key was in an alley behind the block, next to a port-a-potty and bags of trash. I was carrying a lot and definitely felt vulnerable picking it up. Both hosts believe it's safe so that's that.
Also there are tons of tools in the kitchen, but no basics, like tea bags, or cooking oil. There are also tons of inexpensive restaurants in the area.
Summing up: Clean, no frills lodging, strict policies, best for those who are looking for value in the area.","Boston"

On the other side  of the garden is a reasonably busy street but this didn’t bother me too much. The building is old and beautiful and you can expect to hear creaking floorboards and footsteps from those above you and expect to be considerate of those beneath you at all times. It isn’t a property with that lived in feeling that you get from some airbnbs- rather this feels like it is only ever inhabited by other travelers- which isn’t to say its bad, but just what it is. the place was clean and reasonably maintained. Viktoria was nice to deal with and very reasonable. The hot water works perfectly and my family had no issues with our length of showers etc. 

The building next door is undergoing  what looks to me to be a fairly significant construction and there was a fair bit of construction going on on this street. this mostly impacted the vibe sitting on the back deck, but never fear- there are plenty of lovely parks to walk to. 

The location was really good for us- easy stroll to the common, or to work, plenty of food near by, a wholefoods etc. My wife used the buses while i was at work. I walked past a big train station every day- quite close.","Boston"

The bedroom was spacious and with the dressing room and balcony, couldn't be more comfortable. Our mornings were greeted with a soft knock on the door and a beautiful breakfast tray awaiting our retrieval, courtesy of William. (thermos of great coffee, yogurt and fresh fruit and delicious artisan bread and preserves- just the perfect amount to start the day) The weather was quite pleasant during our stay, so we chose to have our breakfast on the balcony and admire the beautiful and well kept garden across the street. We had a car, and although it was not a private parking space, street parking never presented an issue. William does reside on the same floor, however, privacy was not an issue. If you are looking for a party space, this is not it, but if you are looking for a nice reprieve at the end of the day, you will not be disappointed.  Thank you, William.","Boston"

We stayed for 2 weeks with our 4 year old daughter and there was tons of space for us, her, and the toys she had brought! We cooked in the kitchen several nights, (as well as doing breakfast and many lunches in), and made use of the washer and dryer. The facilities were great for an extended stay. There is even a patio with table and chairs which we didn't use but could have.
The area is great -- very convenient to Back Bay and yet with its own South End character. We know Boston well (I'm from the area) but we enjoyed discovering some new restaurants -- there are several great ones within a block or two of the apartment -- and the local playground at the end of Dwight St (crucial if you have small children!)
Phil and Ann were away when we checked in, but Phil was available by phone to help with the check in (crucial since I had mis-recorded the entry code). When we had trouble with the wifi, he gave us an alternate network and password to join.
All in all this is a great place for an extended (or shorter) stay, with or without children. Thanks Phil and Ann.","Boston"

The apartment is just too small & uncomfortable for 4 adults. Both the master bedroom and living room have very comfortable beds. The master bedroom was pretty warm with the hot temperatures in Boston when we went in late August. There is an AC unit in the living room that keeps the living room comfortable but we had to sleep in the master with the door opened & no covers because it was very warm. Paul's place is convenient to the MBTA Blue & Red line. It's not too far from Boston Common if you can make it up the steep hill! There is very little room for storage in the apartment, particularly if you'd like to unpack your belongings. The bathtub was really slippery, not sure if the cleaning solution used made it so but a tub mat/grip is needed.","Boston"

There are a lot of nice shops, bars and cafes in the area as well as parks and subway connections. It was a very good way to experience Boston and I would stay there again. The only problem we had was that as we booked the appartement the evening before we travelled, we did not get an answer on our messages and the code for the lock box before we arrived. We had to call and ask for it a few hours before check in. But the service was good and we got the code eventually. All in all a very good stay.","Boston"

"2584",26160905,332551872,2018-10-05,66940063,"Aric","Nakeisha's place was great!  It is well represented on Airbnb, and she put many special touches on the place, going above and beyond!  The kitchen appeared to be fully stocked with the basics for cooking a simple meal (we didn't cook, but I think it would work for someone who wanted to). The bathroom is nice and spacious, and the bedroom and closet are huge.  She even goes as far to stock snacks and extra toiletries, which we thought was a great touch!  As some other reviewers have noted, the ceiling is low in places.  I'm rather tall, so I had to watch my head in a few places, but it wasn't a problem!  Just something to be aware of... and again, it's only in certain places that it's lower.

Just a heads up about the area... we weren't familiar with Boston when we booked the place, and with that said, next time we'll opt for a place that's in a better location.  First off, it's just not that convenient if you're wanting to explore the city.  It's too far to walk, so you're stuck taking Uber/Lyft or public transportation.  The train station is about a 15 minute walk away, and if you opt for ride share, it'll cost you about $15 to $20 to get into downtown Boston.  Once you add up the time and money spent, you'd be better off getting a place closer to downtown.  If you rent a car, you still have to worry about parking it downtown (which will cost you money) and traffic.  

Secondly, the area right around the unit isn't the best.  It's not the worst, but there are certainly better areas.  I wouldn't feel comfortable walking around at night with my wife.  We didn't think much of it until we had a Lyft driver tell us to be very careful, and to not be out at night.  Maybe he didn't know what he was talking about, but either way, the area certainly isn't the best neighborhood.

I hope my honest review has helped someone else that's unfamiliar with Boston.  If you're looking for a reasonably priced place that's not too close to downtown, and aren't too concerned about the neighborhood, then this is a great place!","Boston"

The apartment itself is darling and we found it to be extremely clean.  It is exactly as advertised.  The stairs are a little steep when you finally get to the apartment and the beds in the bunk room are not that comfortable,  but that is the only downside.  Other than that the apartment is well stocked for anything you may need.  We couldn't find the coffee maker, but no biggie Angela's Cafe across the street had good coffee.

However, I would have appreciated a little more peace around the house. It might have just been a one off day, considering other reviews but there were people over in the house watching the game which was loud till 11:30-12:00 in the night. We had communicated to the host that we have an early flight to catch and hence would be sleeping in early but we weren’t able to get much sleep until midnight because of the noise. This was after we were told that they would keep it down and it would be extremely quiet. The television was loud, people were laughing and talking extremely loudly. The terrace/patio is near the guest room so we could hear them when they were out in the patio too.

Lynel has such fun decor with little photos of pets and quotes about dogs throughout. The downstairs bathroom and bedroom are very spacious and the kitchen is gorgeous. Another plus is that the neighborhood is wonderful as well. The people are so nice and friendly, the streets are well lit, and I absolutely felt safe walking to dinner or the T alone. If you decide to stay at Lynel’s definitely check out Doyle’s (cash only) and take the Sam Adams tour. Both are within walking distance and so fun. Also, having the T station so close by makes going into Boston a breeze. I would definitely stay here again! :)","Boston"

The best part was the location. Just walk out the door turn left then left on Cooper, walk a few blocks and you'll find yourself in a charming, active, urban little neighborhood filled with wonderful restaurants and bakeries. Across Washington you're a stone throw from Boston Public Market. I have Celiac disease so finding a gluten free bakery there was a wonderful unexpected surprise. Jennifer Lee's bakery has the most amazing donuts! (Wished I had brought a dozen home with me.) I was there for a museum tour. I parked the car at the Government center parking garage across the street for $40.00 a day and then traveled around by subway which was also right across the street. I think trying to move around Boston by car would have be extremely difficult and more expensive then parking it in a garage. The subway is very straight forward fairly logical. I found Bostonians to be incredibly helpful and kind anytime needed some advice. Without a doubt I would book again at this lovely place!","Boston"

While I had time, I looked around the house, and seen an assortment of high quality musical instruments. Apparently, Brunir the Host, is an accomplished musician, who also runs a musical studio on the location. I wasn’t bothered by it. The AC helped a lot during those hot days. The shampoo/body wash/conditioner dispenser is a plus. This  home is the Jewel of Hyde Park that you must experience.","Boston"

We used the queen air mattress and it was fine.  The location is outstanding, right near the common, and the space itself, while small, is furnished nicely and has high ceilings. Be aware there are many stairs to climb to the apartment, and being in quite a happening neighborhood, we experienced a bit of noise around us overnight (both within and outside the building).

I had a fantastic stay with Andrea and Tivan. First and foremost, their instructions were very detailed and easy to follow. A quick 10 minute walk from the free airport shuttle stop at the airport T station, and just like that I was tucked into bed. The room was comfortable and cozy and all the essentials were provided.

But best of all was East Boston. My flight wasn't until the next evening, and Andrea and Tivan let me leave my bags upstairs while i went out to walk around. I found a cafe to do a little work, then walked along the water and through the streets lined by clapboard houses, and ended up in an australian pie shop - go figure - a suggestion from my hosts. Next time I'm in Boston I'll be back in the neighbourhood to hang out a little more and grab some of the ubiqitous mexican/central american food on tap.","Boston"

The host did provide coffee, creamer, and sweetener with the Keurig coffee maker. There is a full size fridge, microwave, and stove so you can cook but you'll have to eat at the coffee table in the small living room. 
The bedrooms are small but we were sleeping there, not moving in...had to live out of luggage on the floor and close them and stand them up at night so they we wouldn't trip over them if we got up during the night.
It was a very clean unit and we were on the top floor so we didn't have anyone upstairs to hear - hope our neighbors below didn't hear us either.
One note - we realized we didn't bring any bottled water when we came up to go to bed the first night and remembered we were told this is the area of Boston with good drinking water, so we tried it...and it was pretty good, so don't bother buying/hauling water upstairs.","Boston"

I consulted Jessica on how to get to and from Gillette Stadium before making a reservation. She quickly replied to me and gave very detailed advice (Website hidden by Airbnb) When I entered the door, I saw a warm study and a lot of books in the study. Climbing the building up, entering the room, the desk has a warm table lamp, jessica placed a variety of Boston travel life tips, I was very touched at that moment, I think, this must be a caring landlord.

You walk out your door right on to the street, which has gas lamps and you're like two blocks from the Boston Common and all of Back Bay. It's a really cozy place with two big bedrooms with queen beds and a bathroom upstairs. My bed was really comfy. On the 1st floor there's a whole living room, a dining room and a really big kitchen with everything in it. It's basically a whole house. The best part is the location. You're right in the heart of the best part of Boston and the best restaurants and lunch places are right there. Thanks for having the bathroom stocked with shampoo, conditioner and soap and plenty of towels-very nice. This place could would be fun to bring family and I think the sofa opens to a bed too.  You can cook and have dinner the kitchen is huge. And you can walk everywhere, which is helpful when there's a few people. The Public Garden is right there which is nice.  Location, charm, large space and comfort are the best points of this place. Would definitely stay there again.","Boston"

It's an easy drive or Uber ride to anywhere you want to be, Longwood Medical area,  Faneuil Hall, or the North End.   We walked the neighborhood ate at local restaurants and shopped Foodies. 

A few important points regarding the property, it updated, clean and stocked with anything you need.  (even a bottle of wine) Thanks, Gary!  He is also quick to respond.  I had a  question at 10:30pm, and my text was answered in minutes. 

 2 more important facts, first,  you will most likely NOT find a condo in Boston at this price with two bathrooms!  Second, parking you have free parking unheard of in Boston as well.  If you stay in a Hotel, it's going to fun you anywhere from $25 to $40 per night!  There is only one spot so if you have two cars there is a parking garage that's a 4 min walk.  We used Spot Hero.

It's two blocks behind Copley Place and Prudential Center so ideally located for those venues.  The complex is newer but still fits the historic style of the surrounding area.  The apartment was great and very comfortable and clean.  Comfortable king bed, comfortable sofa, well supplied kitchen, etc.   

I have two very minor complaints, but they are important for those booking this apartment.  The photos in the description are not of this apartment, but rather of another Stay Alfred apartment in the same complex.  It's still comfortable and stylish, but not quite as stylish as the photos.  Additionally, the directions upon entering the gate with the key/fob are slightly off.  Still easy to find after a minor initial confusion, but to be clear, this apartment is in building C on the 2nd floor.  I mentioned these to the host who was very responsive, so this part of the review may become outdated soon.","Boston"

It is well decorated and has great amenities for cooking. The kitchen and bathroom are nicely renovated and in great shape. The apartment is clean where it matters most - the kitchen and dishes were all clean, and the bathroom was also very clean. However, we reviewed it a bit lower for cleanliness because it was a little dusty in the apartment and the pillows were a bit old and yellowed. 

We didn't explore much in the Jamaica Plain neighbourhood, so we can't comment on that. In terms of location, you're fairly close to the subway - about 10 minutes walk to the Orange line (downhill if that's an issue for your mobility). There aren't many amenities within close walking distance and the main places to go in Jamaica Plain are at least 15-25 min walk away, which is why we ended up taking the subway around the city.

If you are a light sleeper or have a baby (like we did), you should be aware that it's an old building and you can hear the neighbours walking or moving chairs in the apartment above, as well their dog. But for most travellers without a napping baby or young children, this probably won't be a big issue.

Kate and Tom were great hosts, very helpful and easy to communicate with.","Boston"

The rooms were spacious, with large closets and plenty of drawer space. I'm used to a very soft bed at home but the bed and pillows were comfortable enough, and there was lots of extra bedding and blankets if needed. The apartment has a modern kitchen that's open to the living area, stocked with a few basic cooking items like oil, salt, pepper, coffee machine and coffee, a kettle, tea bags, silverware, glasses, mugs, cooking pans, etc. Note, there are two bathrooms but only one is connected to a bedroom, the second is more in the main living area, but that wasn't a problem for us. The apartment was very clean, and check in is easy with codes at the front door of the building and apartment--no keys which is nice. The location is great, very near the North End and Waterfront, super easy to walk around or catch an Uber.   Another note, if you have to check out but aren't flying until later and don't want to drag your luggage around, we weren't able to leave it in the apartment since the maids were coming, but we were able to walk right around the corner to the Hilton and store our bags there--they don't ask if you're a guest. Alexander was very quick to respond through the process of booking, and if we had any questions which was very helpful. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone visiting Boston.","Boston"

However, in order for me to see what Yashin wrote, I have to write my own review. I do not wish to berate the host because I filed a request to get my money back and I did get all my money back minus Airbnb's fee I suppose. I can't tell you what happened on the other end, but after providing my exact time of arrival that evening and then subsequently reaching out to the host 4 times (message and one phone call), as we waited for over an hour for someone to greet us and let us in,  I had to make a decision to leave and drive all the way back from Boston to NY.  It took over 2 1/2 hours to hear from the host who tried to inform me that his mother came out to greet us. As soon as we got there I got out of my SUV and went to the gated fence which was locked. No one was there. My SUV was on the street in front of the house for 10-15 minutes with its hazard lights on and still no one came out. I then backed up the SUV on the side of the house where we waited an additional 45 minutes. Still nothing. We left and headed back to NY. I told host I wanted me money back and he was more than willing. He wanted to give me double, but the site would't let him. He wanted to give me free nights in the future. I declined and just told him to refund the allowable amount which he did. I just hope I never have to experience anything like this in the future.","Boston"

- Stellar location.  I don’t think you can find a better location for the price.  Easy access to just about all of Boston via walking, public transportation or bicycle sharing.
- Secure.  Apartment on the 34th floor with digital lock.  Secure parking.
- Great view.  Overlooking Boston Garden.
- Ample space in the room with a full kitchen.
- Henry provides detailed instructions on check-in/out procedures as well as rules of the road for staying at his place.

Con’s

- It’s basically a bachelor crash pad in which you share a bathroom with other guests.  (This may not be an issue for some but it’s something to keep in mind)
- Parking is $48 a day in the apartment building garage.  There may be less expensive options if you are willing to walk or take the T to Government Center, however its the city so expect to pay.
- You are expected to make-up your bed when you check in and strip your bed of linens upon check out.  Henry provides ample clean linens and towels (again, not a big deal to us but something to keep in mind)

Erik has put a good deal of thought into equipping the kitchen well with utensils, and there is a full size oven, hob, microwave, dishwasher, fridge freezer with ice maker. He also left coffee, tea, dishwasher tablets, soap, shampoo and conditioner for our use. There is plenty of storage space, with shelves, rails and coat hangers and it is well air conditioned if it’s hot. 

The apartment is well located in East Boston within a 10 minute walk to two subway stations, only two stops from central Boston. Transfer to the airport is easy, there is a free shuttle bus from Airport Station to the different terminals and the car rental place. There are lots of shops and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. 

Erik left lots of helpful notes about the apartment, recommended restaurants in the area etc, even maps and drawings of the TV remote to help you use the TV, which has Amazon Prime and Netflix - if you’re in and awake long enough to take advantage of it. 

Access couldn’t be easier, it’s all done with door codes, so no liaising to meet up to get keys. We couldn’t have chosen better, thanks Erik!","Boston"

The North End was a great locale- be sure to stop at Regina's for pizza!  Access to fresh baked bread a short walk away on a daily basis was heavenly.  The view was neat-  we could see the USS Constitution from the apartment!
The check in was SUPER convenient. And, we were allowed an early bag drop- which was very nice and because the apartment had already been cleaned by then we were able to stay not just drop the bags). 
The hosts were available to answer any and all questions.  We had an issue with the coffee maker the first morning and they sent someone to fix it before early afternoon.  That was EXCELLENT.
The beds were amazingly comfortable. However, the living room furniture was equally uncomfortable. Worst sofa ever. Finally, the apartment was quite sparsely furnished for 3 people, especially the kitchen. (too few plates and glassware, no serving dishes, that kind of thing).","Boston"

Ravi was responsive, accommodating, and made checking in and out a total breeze. The building is much older than your average hotel, and I would not recommend this unit if you desire a ""plush hotel experience"". There is minimal bathroom space for getting dressed, doing makeup, grooming, etc. The apartment has one sink in the kitchen; there is no sink in the bathroom. There is a window AC unit which was wonderful for our summer stay and cooled the entire unit down very quickly. The decor in the apartment is super unique and abstract - which we LOVED.

Secondly, the unit we stayed in was very nice, spacious, clean and a great value (it was a 1 bedroom 1 bath apt with large common space comprised of living room, eating nook and full kitchen). Furthermore, the staff was absolutely amazing, truly how all hotels should be run! The hotel manager, James (goes by ""J""), was extremely kind, helpful and a pleasure to communicate with; truly 1st rate.

Restaurants (to include the famous Flo's Clam Shack), bars, and shops are just a short walk (2-3 minutes) from the house as well.  The Cliff Walk and downtown Newport are also easily accessible in one direction, as are 2nd/3rd beach and Sachuest Point in the other direction.  

The cottage was immaculate inside and included all the amenities required for a week at the beach.  The kitchen was fully stocked, allowing us to prepare most meals at home.  Cable and WiFi were available for rainy days and A/C allowed us to sleep in comfort during the warm summer nights.  Quality touches included a complimentary bottle of wine and maps and pamphlets describing the local area.

The owners were on site and ready to help with any needs.  At the same time the cottage was very private, given the great location.   We spent most dinners and evenings on the front porch, enjoying the night air but protected by the privacy of tall hedges.

Whether you are visiting in summer or during the off-season, we highly recommend staying at Surfer's Paradise and would gladly rent here again.","Rhode Island"

She was very nice and quite responsive to our needs, even before we asked. She boiled water for us in the morning for oatmeals and also got the coffee going. The entire second floor was for us and we could close the door at the landing to block the noises we made due to our late arrival. The second floor is small but quite charming and cozy. Very clean. Fluffy soft towels, extra white. It was amazing to see how corner spaces were utilized efficiently. We have enough room to put our luggage. 

There were window unit air conditioners in each room except the second bedroom. Recommend to leave its door open at night. We kept the air conditioners running all night. The kitchen in the first floor was for us to use. For small heating-up jobs, the microwave in the second floor is sufficient. 

We were very happy with our stay here. Strongly recommend!","Rhode Island"

The stairs are very narrow, I just had a backpack and would not have wanted to carry luggage up. I did feel that the photos did not exactly match (the room was darker and smaller than pictured), but it wasn’t a big deal. The bed, while roomy, moved around a lot and was creaky, and I was there alone - so more than one person sleeping there might be challenging. The location was within a 20-minute walk to the heart of Providence, and less than 10 minutes’ walk to various shops and restaurants in the Italian district. Natasha said hello when we crossed paths, but respected my privacy when I wanted to be alone. She was also very responsive during check-in. Overall, a clean, cheap stay that allowed me to spend more money on my trip. Would recommend for a solo traveler not looking for luxury.","Rhode Island"

The family room was great for watching a movie at night, smart TV and the internet worked well.  The bathroom has nice roomy shower and bidet with heated toilet seat which was lovely.  Close proximity to Brown U.  Queen bed was comfortable with a mattress topper.  King futon is very firm, and when the trundle pulls out, the mattresses aren't level, so you need to sleep on the bed horizontally, as if it's two side by side couches.

The boat was adorable, nicely decorated, with great amenities, including a fridge, microwave, stove, sink and Keurig. The full bathroom was spacious and clean. The boat had an overall light, fresh airy feel and nice views from the rooftop deck. The one bed and two futons were perfect for our group of three. We received an email with thorough info for checking in, parking, wifi, and info about the area. It says that the area has restaurants in a nightlife area, and that was true even for a Tuesday night. There was live music at the restaurant by the dock that was quite loud so we were serenaded by a guy doing Sinatra covers while we hung out on the boat.  Neil responded to any questions we had promptly. Happy with our stay and wish we could have stayed longer!","Rhode Island"

We only spent two nights there, but it was enough to inspire my first lengthy AirBnB review. The words “inspiring” and “magical” appear multiple times throughout this review- my intention is not redundancy , but to emphasize that I have never been encouraged to use these words this many times in one writing sample, yet alone a AirBnB review. How did we come to find ourselves in Goatopia? We were inspired to go to Rhode Island after a friend from New York invited us to spend a few days in her childhood home in Newport. We had never been to Rhode Island and wanted an opportunity to focus on our own projects. I serendipitously found the Goat Cottage, and emailed Barbara within minutes of reading her listing. When she replied that she could accept us as guests (we were initially concerned due to our late arrival time), we were so excited - and this excitement only intensified when we got there. We arrived late Tuesday night - really early Wednesday morning - and Barbara went above and beyond to text with my partner while we drove, and even had us call her when we arrived to ensure we would not get lost entering the Goat Cottage. We were enthusiastically greeted by River (a great dog) when we drove on to the property, who accompanied Barbara as she generously gave us a tour of where we would be staying - despite it being the wee hours of the morning. We were so worried about our arrival time, but her (and River’s!) welcoming presence really put us at ease. The next morning (really later that morning) we awoke more well rested than we had been in months. Our bedroom filled with natural light at the sun rose in the morning, yet the room stayed comfortably cool thanks to the effort Barbara had put in to provide us with both an air conditioner and multiple fans. Seeing the cottage in the sunlight was truly magically. We thought Barb’s pictures on AirBnB were awe inspiring, but waking up in the Goat Cottage and seeing the unique decorations in the daylight for the first time set such a positive tone for our day (and in many ways the entirety of our trip). We drove less than 10 minutes round trip to a great coffee shop and came back to explore Goatopia a bit before starting our day. We sat on this wonderful bench with shading directly outside of the Goat Cottage, and were even more taken with our surroundings in the daylight. This was the first time we saw the goats in all their frolicking splendor. We were pumped to say hello to the goats and our dog was equally excited to play with River in the morning (although he was definitely jealous/ surprised at how fasts River was, as usually his little...","Rhode Island"

There were ample large towels and even an extra toothbrush! The furniture is an eclectic mixture and all VERY COMFORTABLE.  He was kind enough to have a few adult munchies, fruit, and a note with wifi info & local places he recommended. I used to be a native of Newport and he was spot on!

A few tips for living here:

Cooking - the pots and pans are pretty old and the knives are really dull, there also weren't  tools like a can opener.

Parking - the parking situation in Providence is pretty annoying. there's no overnight street parking unless you are a Providence resident and the garage is 2 long blocks away. 

Noise- the walls are also thin, so there is always the possibility that someone next door with be obnoxiously loud. 

Decor - the building itself just very  old,  decor is  minimal and uncoordinated and the furniture is pretty outdated but everything serves it's purpose. 

Pets - this apartment is also very very pet friendly and while I was here for the month we almost always had an animal. so if you're allergic or don't like cats/dogs, I would not recommend this apartment. but if you like animals, it's wonderful. 

overall, I think this place is good for students on a budget. but i wouldn't expect too much more than the basics.","Rhode Island"

It was so easy to get in touch with the host, Yosefa. She is the nicest and most caring person! This home has such a fun, eclectic, and artistic flair to it. It was quaint, cozy, and spotlessly clean! Yosefa truly went above and beyond in designing the perfect Airbnb. The home had everything we could possibly need and want like fans, AC, super comfy beds, nearby menus, luxurious towels, toiletries, a fully stocked kitchen, and tons of drinks and snacks, including snacks for our dog! You couldn’t ask for a better location. It was amazing to be in the heart of Federal Hill. There was so much to do and see nearby but it was also great being tucked away on a quiet side street. We really loved spending time grilling and relaxing in the beautiful and private backyard. I SO highly recommend this Airbnb! It felt like a home away from home and we can’t wait to come back!","Rhode Island"

She welcomed us with fresh flowers and organic coffee and brownies, and the kitchen was well-stocked with essentials and breakfast items. In addition to being meticulously well-kept and well-supplied, the house is full of thoughtful personal touches that make it feel welcoming and homey.  Despite its central location, the street feels tucked away and is very quiet. The floorboards are a bit creaky and the clawfoot tub may not be practical for some, but overall the positive aspects significantly outweigh anything else. Both Pat and her place are wonderful and we would recommend this airbnb to anyone!

Everything about The Captain’s House was perfect. The kitchen was so clean and modern. The living area was comfortable and updated. We couldn’t stop talking about the hand made kitchen table and now we all want one just like it for our homes! We loved the vintage decorative feel of the place with the records, record player, book collection, cameras, etc. 

Bennett’s responsiveness couldn’t have been faster. Anytime I emailed him he responded in minutes. We REALLY appreciated Bennett coming over right away to install another air conditioning so promptly after one of the old units in the bedrooms broke. 

Bennett’s recommendations for food allowed us to discover a new awesome breakfast place - Stoneacre! Hands down one of the best breakfasts I’ve had in a very long time - not to mention the cold brew!  

The location of the house was perfect. Easy walk to Thames, but located on a very quiet street. My wife is in a waking boot and we still had no issues with walking to Thames or any of the local restaurants.

The cleanliness is greatly appreciated! Our room was stocked with some water, replenished daily, and Wendy even made me a little bag of ice to keep my leftovers cold for our long drive home.

My hubby and I found Nicole’s guest house right outside of Newport and Narragansett (absolutely gorgeous) upon searching for a location to take a little vacation before our first child arrives  in November.  And I’m so glad we booked it when we did because we really had a beautiful and memorable time.

Upon arrival, Nicole greeted us and showed us to the guest house attached to her home in a very quiet and beautiful neighborhood.  The house was super clean with an amazing kitchen (I’m a foodie and love to cook so I appreciated this kitchen), a beautiful and modern bathroom and comfortable and large studio space with a king bed.  The pool/pool house were also amazing and I enjoyed them (main reason I booked the home :) ) I wish the weather was better but we still got to use the pool! Overall, everything about the home exceeded our expectations and we were SO happy to stay there.

Nicole is probably the BEST host ever, by the way if anyone ever had to know before booking. She is super friendly, kind, accommodating, quick to respond to any questions you might have and we are definitely going back next year just for her. You can tell she is just a phenomenal person and she is so happy to accommodate anyone for a good vacation. She even bought us a gift for our baby girl with a card that touched our hearts. I actually cried. It was just such a nice touch and really beautiful. Thank you so much Nicole!!!! See you next year

Our stay was amazing. It feels like a home. Pamela is a very loving and caring person and she makes sure everything is ready for her guests. She takes care of every single detail. 
She offered us an amazing continental breakfast and a conversation that made us get to know each other better! 
The location of the place is amazing as we were half-way from most of the beaches, the closest one Gooseberry beach and half-way from all the restaurants/bars and shops at Thames St. 
We rented a car and it was perfect to move around and park in front of Pamela’s house for free. 
The room does not have AC if you plan to go during summer season, but you won’t need it because at night Newport gets chilly and you can sleep really well. She offered us a fan, but we did not used it at night.

The side room with the bunk beds gets a little cold if the door is closed due to the fact that there's 2 walls that have windows. Other than that it was perfectly warm! There were water bottles in the fridge for us which was a nice touch since all of us were extremely thirsty after coming back from a night out. The location was also great, was right off of Atwells Ave and a quick uber to bars. The only issue we had was in the morning. We got back very late and went to sleep around 3 AM, only to be woken up at 6AM by people in the unit upstairs literally stomping around and running across the apartment. It was so annoying as it was so early and I barely got to sleep. This continued on and off for hours until they left at like 9 or 10 AM. As they were leaving they kept repeatedly stomping up and down the stairs.

"3312",22061788,285388654,2018-07-03,33664534,"Cheyney","Judie’s little cottage is adorable and suited our needs perfectly for a one night stay in the area. She gave awesome instructions and left little touches around the house (including a brief history of the place which we found really interesting)! The fresh eggs from her chickens were definitely appreciated and overall, we had a great stay. 

A few things to note to future guests: in the summer, it can get very warm in the house. That being said, Judie provides ample fans and there are window units all over the place... which came in handy! The rooster will announce the start of the morning, and it being a cottage, little moths and bugs do fly in when you open doors. This is under no fault of the host, but it is something to note. It’s just a part of being in the country! It makes it more authentic, right? The wet room/shower can also get very very warm in the morning, just because there is a sky window and the sun will heat the room very quickly. The wet room itself is actually pretty cool though. Also, try to arrive when the sun is still up. While Judie provides ample directions to the little cottage, we drove by a few times by accident because it was just so dark. We found it just fine and it was exactly as described, but finding places like this are always a little more difficult in the dark! 

Overall, Judie is a lovely host and the cottage is a fun stay.","Rhode Island"

"3331",18751809,240676903,2018-03-05,128215943,"Karl","It’s a cheap place to stay. The reasons are:
- The place needs work: it’s an old fixer-upper that hasn’t had regular upkeep in years. If you want a place that is clean or seems new, this may not be a good match.
- There are two other rooms that could be occupied, so privacy is guaranteed only in your room. 

That being said, the value is still solid given the price for the following reasons. 
- Mike is clearly improving the space as he goes. The longer it’s been since I wrote this, the better it will be when you get there. 
- Mike is extremely helpful, friendly, responsive, and skilled as a host. 
- All the basic amenities are provided, and the room itself is clean and comfortable.
- It’s in a great part of town, with access to Federal Hill, Downcity, and West End extremely walkable.","Rhode Island"

The photos do not reflect how nice it is. Noreen and Bob warmly welcomed us at the house upon arrival. We appreciated the gift basket.  
While the cottage has a retro look and feel, it has the necessary amenities and some extras – cable TV, Wi-Fi, air conditioning, laundry facilities, beach chairs and tennis courts across the street. The house was very clean, well kept and reflected the quiet, small town of Jamestown. 
Although the cottage is small, it worked well for us (four adults might be too tight and the small bedroom is better suited for children).
We enjoyed our first trip to Rhode Island and our stay in this house. I would certainly recommend a stay at this lovely cottage.","Rhode Island"

The apartment was clean and cute with a retro design, but with that came an old tub, and dated appliances.  The fridge is a 50's style fridge, which means there is no usable freezer, and the stove is gas.  During our stay, the oven did not work, and there was no frying pan/toaster.  Without any changes, I think this is a good stay for 1-2 nights but for longer stays I would check that this issues have been addressed.

We had the pleasure of meeting Jennifer and she was just as sweet in person! We even fell asleep for a while on the hammock out back (even though it’s a busy street we didn’t hear any of the noise back there). We utilized the jacuzzi which was very relaxing. They had a fire pit all set up & even stuff to make s’mores, we didn’t get a chance to enjoy that, but everything shows how much thoughtfulness goes into this. There is also a nice sitting room with a full fridge in the guest area of the house- bathroom being separate was not an issue at all!

The host has wonderful and quick response on my needs including accommodating a parking lot for us since Providence City doesn't allow over night parking without any permits. Decent size of 3 bedrooms, kitchen, living room and bathroom but need TLC on the entire house including some nice furniture. Some window blinds are missing or damaged in the bedrooms, so the privacy is a concern. A restaurant is on the first floor and the house always have food odor for the entire stay, but I left windows open to eliminate the odor. There is also loud music from the restaurant during their business hours, which until 11:30 pm and weekend has band playing at the restaurant too. So, sleeping is a challenge with loud music. There are washer and dryer for laundry. Both are working well which good for longer stay guests. The restaurant at first floor has good Moracan food and tea, despite the food odor to the house. I would recommend to try the restaurant, especially if you arrive late to the house. That restaurant will be there for you to eat.","Rhode Island"

We enjoyed the lake a bit Friday afternoon, but it was raining the rest of the weekend so we drove to Providence (only about 30 minutes away) and did some shopping. Tom offers everything you need in this cozy place –– eggs, wine, delicious bread, and other cooking/shower/sleep things.

She was always on top of answering any messages we sent, she upgraded us to the star room when our original room was no longer available without hesitation. There were homemade soaps, bodybutter and aroma therapy sprays available for us to test out which made our stay feel like we were in the coziest of spas! 

We always had clean towels and the room was very clean. We also had out own private entrance when we were upgraded so we felt comfortable exploring the neighboring towns and not disturbing them when we came back in. 

We even spent a night in after exploring providence just snuggling in bed watching tv because it was so cozy!

The location was ideal, we felt safe and it was so nice to be outside the city but close enough that we could explore multiple places in Rhode island and even Massachusetts as well!! 

Unlike most places Cindy actually provided breakfast!! such a nice gesture. and she had a lovely well behaved puppy, Lucas who melted our hearts. 

She was always engaging and willing to talk about any suggestions but she also had a scrap book and always laid out the latest magazines with recommendations of things to do and places to eat. How amazing is that! 

all and all an amazing time and definitely a place worth staying.  We'll definitely be back soon!","Rhode Island"

Although we were on their property, we felt as though we had total privacy. They are very pet friendly, which was the main reason we chose their home, as we have two small dogs and had a hard time finding a hotel that accepts pets in the area.

They had fresh roses in the dining area when we arrived, and tons of snacks and breakfast items stocked; including juice, milk, coffee, creamer, and oatmeal. They also provided basic toiletries, but plan to bring your own.

They must live near a fire station, because we heard fire trucks go by often. It wasn't a nuisance, just something we noticed, but they were VERY clear in their description that this was a city area and we should expect noise.

The automatic gate was a huge plus. We felt very safe and secure because of that. It is a simple cottage. Don't stay here if you expect a 5-star experience. It's a quaint little place in the middle of the city.  This is a great place to be near the main parts of RI. We were within 5 minutes of everything we came to do.

The space is really homey and cute and has a great view of water and is less than half a mile from the beach in either direction. Pamela was responsive when we had a kitchen fan that wouldn't turn off and questions about the lighting in the space. It was pretty affordable and spacious for 4 people. I did wish that we knew that there was a bridge toll (only and it was 4 dollars!!) between newport and jamestown because we would have gone to kingstown for our groceries and stuff! Other than that, great stay and we'd recommend this place for sure","Rhode Island"

Everything was close by, even a short walk away to the cliff walk. It was nice that there was a small fridge and she made sure that we had everything that we needed (utensils, mugs, wine glasses, etc.). The place felt super homey, spacious, and was so comfortable to come back to after a long day out. Meg always got back to me promptly and was kind enough to recommend a few local restaurants, which we ended up really enjoying.

Then they left you snacks and drinks and even slippers if you need them. The beautifully renovated bathroom for your exclusive use is across from your room, stocked with fluffy towels and toiletries. Get the picture? It’s in the middle of east side neighborhood so you can quickly walk to Wayland Square or go for a run on the park-like Blackstone Boulevard-or down to the river. It’s lovely.

The only trouble we had was the outside light that would turn on due to any movement inside the room or out the master bedroom window. My friend could not sleep in this room.  I recommend Ryan to add blackout curtains or if he could turn this off for guest. The condo was fully stocked with towels and toilet paper.

The house is stocked with all your beach needs....chairs, towels, toys and a handy beach cart. Not having to bring all that stuff is one more thing you don't have to worry about.  Wood was supplied for the fire pit  that we used every night and made s'mores. We ate on the deck daily.  The yard is big enough to play catch, and he kids enjoyed the playground around the corner. The walk to the beach was a little longer than I expected but very doable. However, we preferred driving to Wheeler or Scarborough Beach where there are bathrooms, showers and snack bar. Wheeler beach also has a play ground and picnic tables.  Newport is a half hour drive, and the Block Island Ferry is just 10 minutes away.  If you have toddlers you should know there is no bathtub, but you can make do with the kitchen sink or outdoor shower. You will also have to be cautious of the stairs and railing.  Charter a fishing boat and catch dinner! There is something thrilling about catching fish! We had a great time and great memories were made!  Thanks Nick for being on top of things!!","Rhode Island"

She is a wonderful hands-on host - hospitable, attentive to your needs, and genuine about wanting to make your stay there as comfortable, stress-free, and enjoyable as possible. For the most part, anytime we had a question, she responded quickly.  Just remember to call her if she doesn't respond to a text. This was my first time using Airbnb, and Melissa exceeded my expectations as host!  Airbnb should hire her to train other people to be hosts!  I've mostly rented from Home Away before, and none of the other hosts came close to Melissa!  

That being said, the home was perfect for my family of 5 adults.  It was just the right size for us to spread out and play board games, watch movies, cook in the kitchen, and play pool. The gas grill was great so we didn't heat up the house, and the Air Conditioners were ""Out of this World!!""  The week we stayed there was quite a scorcher and we would have been miserable without those AC units!

The Westerly location was so convenient to all the beaches and sights we planned to explore: Misquamicut Beach, Mystic Aquarium, Narragansett, Watch Hill's East Beach, Napatree Point Conservation, and catching the ferry at Point Judith for Block Island.  Originally, we thought we needed to find a house on the beach to enjoy Rhode Island, but we were wrong!  We discovered that we didn't want to hang out at the same beach every day.  Plus, most of the rentals that were available on the beach didn't come with AC!  So do yourself a favor, and rent from Melissa! My family had a great time and I love Rhode Island now (more than Cape Cod)!","Rhode Island"

I strongly feel that they are friends or family who have been asked to write reviews   Our experience was nothing like what had been reviewed. To be fair we arrived early as our bus was early and this never happens. We were only 45 min early though. Rather than arriving at 10pm we arrived at 9:15pm. Our experience was awful. We couldn’t find the building as there was no lit address. There happened to be someone standing out front who told us what the address was or we wouldn’t have found it. We then endured a painful process of being directed to park in a manner that would have blocked us in unable to leave in the morning. We then went in, it smelled like mold and mildew. The best way I could describe the smell is like sour workout clothes. We entered our room, Steven showed us where the bathroom was and left.  We soon noticed the bed wasn’t made!  There was a quilt for a twin bed on the queen sized bed, under that was a flat sheet for a twin bed, and a mattress pad! That is it!!! Steven had led us to the room said, “said have a good night” and left. There was no mention of the room not being ready or that he would be back. After he left I called him and told him the bed was not made. When I called he said he had sheetss in the dryer and would bring them in making it sound like he ever an intention on returning after having left the first time.  Had I not called about no sheets on the bed he would not have returned with sheets. He then acted helpless like he didn’t know how to make a bed and I ended up making the bed. After making the bed I asked if he had pillowcases as there were only shams on the pillows. This led to an excruciating conversation where I had to explain the difference. Finally he returned with two pillowcases. I then went to use the bathroom and there was feces smeared on the wall by the toilet paper, hair in the sink and shower and the toilet seat was disgusting. It was so bad I took a shower in my flip flops. The whole experience was terrible and unfortunately our first experience with Airbnb. I don’t foresee another experience we will stick with  hotels.","Rhode Island"

The home is very old, which shows in some areas. Would definitely recommend and would stay there again.","Rhode Island"

I originally thought it might be a bit too crowded but the house is spacious and well-designed, and was perfect for us. I wouldn't hesitate to book it again or recommend it to friends.

Favorite parts: the bottom floor is all for living / hang-out space. The 6 bedrooms are all located on the 2nd and 3rd floors. There are 2 full baths plus 2 additional half-baths so I never had to wait to use a bathroom. The huge dining table allows all of us to chat and hang out together in one room. There was also plenty of towels, linens, and some toiletries for use. The house was beautifully decorated - it's what I imagine my perfect vacation home to be like. The check-in process was a breeze, no need to coordinate keys. The driveway could fit 4-5 cars, and the neighborhood's quiet but still close to downtown (5 minute drive or 30 min walk).

Kelly was really easy to communicate with - she usually responded within the hour during the few days before/after we were there. Also, one of my friends left an item at the house, and she graciously grabbed it and dropped it off in Boston for us. Would 100% stay here or another of Kelly's properties in the future!","Rhode Island"

It seems like a lovely place to rest on a summer holiday by the sea. Unfortunately, I had to be in Rhode Island on one of the coldest nights of the year. The area was still blanketed by thick snow from the recent storm, so my judgment is based solely on the room. It was fine, but lacking in space and furniture -especially for two: I was with my daughter. I didn't realize that there was no kitchen, either. That was my fault for not examining the listing thoroughly. However, I was a bit disappointed. It didn't like such a great value after all. On the bright side, the bed was comfortable and the heating was good. The provided space heater was useful, because the room is an extension of the house, facing the sea, and as I said it was COLD!!

The bed on the left the springs were so loud every-time u moved. It kept waking my daughter up who is 2. Thank god I brought her pack & play since my husband & I both slept in the right side bed the 2nd night. Also the corners of the bedrails stick out on both bed frames.

You get your own private space on the second floor of the house, with a bedroom, sitting room, and bathroom that are all separated from the rest of the house by a door you can lock. It was a bit strange to come in the front door one night and find someone sleeping on the sofa in the first floor living room, but that might be part of the other rentable space. 
It's a pretty easy ~20 minute walk to restaurants on Broadway, if you don't want to drive. The minifridge was helpful for saving leftovers, and cereal, Yoplait, bananas, and coffee supplies are provided. The house across the street was having a loud party one night, but having the A/C on drowned it out.","Rhode Island"

It is placed perfectly to give you a quite getaway while staying close to the major local attractions. There is a tennis court, park, and running paths all within a stones throw from the front yard. The interior of the house reflects the hostess, Louisa, which is incredibly beautiful, eclectic, and one of a kind. She recommended local restaurants such as Mantunuck Oyster Bar which is by far one of the best coastal dining experiences we have had in a while.

Pretty large place and good value. We were surprised it stayed nice and warm, since it's a basement flat, but no issues with heat in the main area. Kitchen can be chilly, but there's a portable heater you can use if needed. Be aware that you'll hear some noise from upstairs, sometimes knocking out clacking (maybe the heat or other utilities), but it generally didn't inhibit sleep or otherwise affect our stay. Both hosts were kind and responsive, even gave us $10 back because a contractor needed access to the kitchen for 30 minutes. They go above and beyond! All the supplies you could want, fast wifi, easy street parking, extra storage space, etc. Highly recommend :)","Rhode Island"

"4003",24908161,342237415,2018-10-28,207091218,"George","For what you actually pay, this place is good value. It is in a good location just off of Atwells Avenue with lots of lovely restaurants and bars, and within walking distance of the Omni Hotel and, by extension, the rest of Providence. The bed is comfortable, but the airbed didn't really hold air (hopefully this will be addressed soon) and the sofa isn't really big enough to sleep on. A word of suggestion to future guests: in the winter it gets very cold unless you have the heating on full which, whilst quite loud, will beat the cold. Plenty of extra blankets should you be chilly though. 

The shared kitchen area is very good: large and nicely finished with basically everything you'll need. There is a printer too, which is handy for boarding passes etc. Shower was good (turn the nozzle the whole way around for max temp and water pressure). 

Other suggestions: I had it on good authority (from an older taxi driver that had lived in Providence all his life) that the Old Canteen in the place to eat, so go there. I enjoyed lunch and coffee at Ellie's Bakery. The people of Providence were very friendly and entirely pleasant to be around. I enjoyed my trip!","Rhode Island"

Everything is a bit run down and it smells like a urinal. There was a hole by the window in the ceiling which looked as though bugs had been crawling through. When you go to use the shower,the head is broken and so a stream shoots straight up and hits the ceiling and pools up water, that then drips into your face. The fresh soap and lotion was already opened 1/2 used.  Garbage /delivery trucks from the alley directly behind where your window is, woke us up early in the morning.  The towels felt like sandpaper. Honestly the only good thing about this place is the free breakfast. Get the French toast it's amazing.

It is clean, spacious, comfortable, sunny (but with blinds if you want to sleep in), and quiet. It is easy to find, has simple check-in/check-out, and tons of space (we were tempted to skip sightseeing and just snuggle up on the recliner couches for the day!). 

The icing on the cake was the best-stocked Airbnb kitchen I've ever encountered. Aside from having a variety of staples that are often missing from Airbnb homes (salt, pepper, oil, coffee, etc), the fridge was also stocked with bread, milk, eggs, juice, and a myriad of other goodies! It was such a nice treat and felt extra special. Thanks Delores!","Rhode Island"

The location is great, a 5 minute drive to both Scarborough and Roger Wheeler beaches, and just down the road from Sunset Farm for fresh corn and Galilee for lobsters.  It had everything we needed (although we did bring our own sheets and towels.)  The back deck was great for relaxing on, and the living room and bedrooms were very homey and comfortable, with a great ocean cross-breeze in the evenings. We didn't meet Nita, but she was very easy to communicate with and made us feel right at home. I would definitely recommend this cottage to anyone looking for a place to stay during a beach vacation in Narragansett.","Rhode Island"

I had a ringing of the ears. When I asked if I could unplug it while I slept, they said yes, but in the morning they told me that they had missed an AirBnB client because of that, and I felt guilted. They offered to refund me if I left, but the refund never came through (that could be on Airbnb’s end). She also said that she would have to give me a bad review because “other people should know of your sensitivity”. I think you are not allowed to AirBnB two houses if one of them you don’t live in. I also think this was a very intense router, not your average router. I do not like to give bad reviews, but it was not an enjoyable experience and cost me time and money during a week when I was already moving houses (I had booked for a week while we waited for our place to be ready). Perhaps it’s  an anomaly of an experience, but I thought I’d share.","Rhode Island"

Not only did she write a note, she set up the wine glasses and had purchased a bottle of wine for us to share! I've never had anyone do that before. Oh and the towel, hand towel and facecloth in every room for the number of people we had staying was really great in itselg, but I was delighted to find they were each topped with a candy!

We had 10 children and 4 adults and it was only enough beds for 10 maximum. When we asked for an airmattress that was promised, the first one we were given has a huge tear in it. The next night we were told our kids “could use the sofa on the porch” He actually expected our 10-14 year old girls to sleep on a porch outside! We were then promised a brand new air mattress which eventually arrived the next night at 9 pm when it was promised by 5, which was filthy dirty and again had a puncture. The bedrooms had mild on the ceiling, the house had an awful smell that won’t go away despite leaving the windows open. It was so dirty he host came back to clean it again but just mopped the dirty floors and never actually cleaned it. There was only enough plates bowls etc for 6 people and when  we requested more we were given paper plates. There was no toaster on arrival but did receive one the 2nd day. There was rats in the back yard. I can’t even explain how many lies the host told us when we asked for things to be corrected or to give us what was promised in the listing. We had so many sob story’s. Again, DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOSTS PROPERTIES","Rhode Island"

Jillian gave us a thorough tour of the apartment and was quick to reply to any questions. We took her recommendation to visit Rebelle Bagel, and it was delicious! She was really flexible and let us drop our bags off earlier than the check-in time. 

Overall, a great stay and highly recommended!

The location is remarkable as you are right in the heart of downtown Newport and in walking distance to amazing restaurants and shops.  With a beautiful view of the ocean from the rooftop deck and from one of the top floor rooms, this place is a definite must stay.  I traveled with my wife, our 1 year old daughter and our family dog and the place was very spacious.  With convenient parking in the driveway for one car it was easy to unload all of our luggage and feel like we are at home within minutes.  I highly recommend staying here if you are visiting Newport.  
Also in case you are new to Newport, I have a few recommendations for restaurants... 
- Diego's is the best restaurant I have been to as my wife and I have been going there everytime we are in town
- Scales & Shells, which is just steps away from the townhouse, has a great selection including their cod, the white clam sauce pasta and shrimp appetizer were all delicious
- Harry's Burger & Beer has a great selection of sliders
- There are also 2 great breakfast places nearby: Peaceable Market, which is right across the street from Scales & Shells, and Fatulli's Downtown Cafe, which has a great selection of pastries
All in all, my family had a wonderful time and we will definitely stay here again!","Rhode Island"

When I travel to a new city, I spend most of my time exploring restaurants and bars and other landmarks, so I hardly spend any time actually IN my airbnb. Therefore, all I'm looking for is a place to come and go (usually getting home after the bars close) and a nice bed and shower. I've spent a lot of money on airbnb's that have a lot of unnecessary designer decor etc and that's all lost in me. All I need is a clean place to crash and wash up and this place was exactly that.

"4322",16543279,342385006,2018-10-28,18503479,"William","Nice space in a nice location. Fox Point is a neat neighborhood.  College Hill next door and easy walk to Downtown.  Bike/scooter share (Lime, Bird, Jump) and car share (ZipCar) are in Providence now.  Uber/Lyft to/from PVD airport was about $15-20 for me.  Felt very safe in the neighborhood.  
This is Jeanne's home and the best summary I could come up with is that it's like staying at your cool aunt's/sister's/daughter's (your choice will depend on your age) place while she's away.  Apartment was clean and ready when I showed up for checkin; no issues with the place.  It's an urban neighborhood so you'll have some street sounds and you can hear the upstairs neighbors walking around at times but mostly it's peaceful; no problems sleeping.  Minor sounds of life don't bother me but if you like *absolute* quiet, you should know this.  
Only minor issue with my stay was communication.  No responses to multiple AirBnB messages and when I called the day of checkin, I got voicemail and no return call.  However, Jeanne was there when I arrived for checkin @ 3pm.  She explained she'd had some problems with her AirBnB account and I believe her as she seems very sincere.  The lack of communication caused a little anxiety but, since everything worked out fine, it's water under the bridge.  
Summary:  Nice place, would recommend, and would stay there again.","Rhode Island"

The location is wonderful, close to great restaurants but tucked a little bit away from the downtown crowds in a quiet neighborhood near some of Providence's most beautiful homes. All the extra special touches like welcome pastries from Seven Stars and spare toiletries really made it feel like home. There were 8 of us and we had plenty of space for meals and there were many little nooks (like the cute tree house) to hide away for some private time when needed. The front porch swing and backyard hammock were coveted spots during our weekend stay. The beds were very comfortable, a perfect home away from home. I'd recommend it highly to anyone visiting Providence.","Rhode Island"

She went above and beyond by providing toiletries, breakfast, and even let me keep my bag at her place during the day after I had checked out. She is a Newport native, so knows what to recommend in the area. The location couldn’t be better- on the quieter side of Thames Street, but moments from the action. I woke up to the gentle ocean breeze and sounds of seagulls outside my window.

"4334",20136742,264249727,2018-05-13,183628703,"Aman","This was one of the three bedrooms in the house, two of which were rented out on AirBnB by the host. There was a student living in the third room paying rent to the host. 

About the room: It's a small room with a bed in the center. We basically used this place to sleep at night. It had a closet, clean towels, lamp shade, and a dust bin. The sheets were clean. The floor is carpeted with dark color, so I cannot say about it's cleanliness but it seemed vacuumed.

About the bathroom: The host cleaned the bathroom every afternoon. There was good water pressure and hot water.

Entering the place: The instructions were not very clear for check in, so we entered the wrong room. We were informed that it was the incorrect room on phone as the host came to the house later in the afternoon. We had a brief chat with the host when he arrived. He was clear with directions in person and offered suggestions about places to go near Providence. He was very hospitable.

Location: This is right on Wickenden street, so many places to eat/drink nearby. This is a 10 minute walk to Brown and RISD. Very good location.

Other comments: We could use microwave if we wanted. The student had dishes in the basin etc. The student was quiet and in his room mostly, so there was no disturbance due to sound etc.","Rhode Island"

The beds were comfortable and the outdoor shower was so nice (and had warm water) after a day at the beach. The bedrooms are all good sized and we ended up using the downstairs family room as an additional bedroom because it has a door. The pictures are true to the house and we were very impressed with how well the house has been kept.
Dean left passes for Kelly beach, which is just down the road. Kelly beach is a wonderful beach and is especially good for kids, as it is sheltered so the waves are small and it is a very gradual drop into the water. The location of the house is good - walking distance to restaurants, ice cream, and a liquor store. The only downside is the walk to the beach is about a mile and you have walk on a stretch of road without sidewalks or a shoulder. Luckily, people drive slowly there since they seem accustomed to people walking on that road.
We would definitely stay in this house again.","Rhode Island"

Although there was a major heat wave in Providence, our living space stayed nice and cool thanks to the central air controlled by the Nest thermostat. The space is plenty large, and the bathroom with two sinks and a modern shower was spacious and very clean. The bed was comfortable, and the neighborhood and house were quiet at night. We slept very well!  

Weather permitting, you can walk to the nearby Hope St neighborhood shops, where we picked up some unique kitchen items and crafty gifts. 

This being our first trip to Providence, we were impressed with the town and the many good, local places to eat.

 We were very comfortable staying in Josh and Kate's property and will definitely seek it out first whenever we get to Providence again.","Rhode Island"

The apartment is equipt with microwave and small refrigerator. The bed is comfy. Bathroom has plenty of towels. Room temperature could be easily adjusted with manual thermostat. The area is well lit at night. Just know there are some steps leading into the apartment (which was totally fine for us but unexpected & may have been a slight issue for my mom had she gone).

Kelli has thought of absolutely everything you may need on your vacation. From croissants to eggs, milk, jam, cereal and more, to all kinds of bath products, lotions, q-tips, organic products and so much more. If you forget something she will have it! I was amazed at her attention to detail through out the apartment. It's decorated beautifully and there are delightful surprises around every corner for young and old. I also loved being with in walking distance to so many hidden gems for dining out, but be sure to make a reservation it gets busy.

I stayed here for a whole week while attending a week-long seminar at Brown University. I was afraid that it would feel claustrophobic but it didn't, at all. The kitchen is open and other rooms lead off it. Everything was very clean - the shower was fantastic - very strong water pressure! Wi-Fi worked with no problem, as well as cable tv. Mary left very clear information regarding garbage disposal/recycling (not complicated) as well as listing a large number of restaurants, stores, etc., when I booked. When I needed to contact her over a minor matter, she was right there and was friendly and helpful (via phone). The neighborhood felt safe and I was comfortable as a female staying there alone - the apartment is on the first floor of a house but it is slightly raised from the level of the street. If I attend the seminar next year, I would not hesitate to stay at Mary's place again.","Rhode Island"

We had ample amount of towels and basic mugs and utensils for all the guests. There is also a driveway where 2 cars can be parked - which is great and the deli shop down the street is great to start the day.

My only concerns were that the bathroom doors did not lock so our group of 6 had to coordinate while using them and the fact that AC in one of the rooms upstairs wasn't that effective - although that was probably because of a very hot summer day. Other than that,  I had a good experience staying at Desi and Eric's.","Rhode Island"

Parking was easy as was check-in. Walter was very nice and accommodating. Common area, bedroom and bathroom were all very clean. Locking door for bedroom (which is nice because we were right off the common room).

Price seemed very competitive for the area, but Newport is an expensive place to visit.

Only negative was we were expecting s completely private bathroom, but the bathroom was off of the common room. This was not a big deal for us- just something to consider if it is something overly important for you.

A fun thing about the place is that the neighbor's dog shares the electric fence with this house, so the dog will come and play. The house has space enough to hang out. It is a lived-in house, which is fine, so you can tell that a dog  lives there. They let us know whatever in the kitchen can be used, but the fridge is also already half full. It is 11 min by car to Newport, 5 min by car to the beach or Norman's bird sactuary. The price is about 2 hotel rooms, so it's good for families over 4 people.

This was fine, accept that this apartment did not have access to a washer or dryer (when the listing said there would be access), did not have a hair dryer, did not have more than one roll of TP (my reservation was initially for 5 days), and did not have a clean shower. When I informed the hosts that there was no hairdryer they asked me to look again and said that maybe someone stole it. They then replaced it with a new one within a few hours. The same deal when I informed them about TP. When I first took a shower I noticed some hair that was not mine hanging out from the past guest. I didn't think to complain as I was already unpacked and did not really want someone coming in to clean after I was already checked in. Throughout the day I heard banging in the other apartment and figured it was someone working on the fridge next door. Also, the apartment is located on the first floor facing the street with huge windows so you hear all of the street traffic and the other tenants coming and going through the heavy entrance door. Also, a man entered the apartment when I was asleep on the sofa the first day. I told him he was in the wrong place and he said he was the landlord with lightbulbs and was sorry. The fact that anyone with the door code can let themselves into this rental is alarming and made me feel very unsafe. On my third night, I went to bed with the other tenants being a little noisy. I was woken at 12:30AM to a frat party. Complete with shouting voices and loud music with heavy base. I was completely shocked that this was a possibility in this airbnb rental. I communicated with both of the hosts what was going on and also ended up calling the police department several times and filing repeated noise complaints. One of the hosts came and met the police, but the party-goers quieted down only to continue to party after the police left. The hosts told me they talked to the landlord (who contacted the partiers), they called the tenants, emailed, and talked to them in person. However, the party continued until 4:00AM. The hosts apologized to me several times during this situation, but I was not offered a way out of the situation until I wrote them explaining that I needed another rental or a refund. The next morning, I was offered a rental that was west of Federal Hill (which I was told my a local is not the best neighborhood to walk alone at night) that they charged less for (but I was not offered a refund for the difference). I told them that I...","Rhode Island"

Close location to everything you want from Newport!  If there is one downside not captured in the other reviews it is that, because of the proximity to the road a restaurants, it can be a bit noisy at night - no problem if you are young and our partying, but less so if you have brought your 77 yr old mum with you for a few days R&R.

All beds had linens, blankets and towels and bathrooms stocked with toilet paper, soap, and small shampoos. There were individual AC units to help keep areas cool and plenty of windows for airflow when AC wasn’t needed. The lawn is HUGE and perfect for lawn games and enjoying nice weather when we didn’t feel like trekking to the beach. Everything is close by and within a 10 minute drive or Uber.

Their adorable Newport Beach retreat was the perfect place for my husband and I to spend our 2nd wedding anniversary weekend in the Newport area. The space itself is cozy, clean, and well decorated making it so cozy and comfortable. It had all the amenities that a hotel or rental needs plus some. Keurig coffee maker, a variety of toiletries in the bathroom to use, cable tv, a stellar collection of VHS tapes to watch, plenty of linens and towels, and beach gear for the beach that’s right down the street (although it wasn’t warm enough to go to the beach, it’s nice to have the option to utilize the things). They have a detailed binder of things to do around Middletown and Newport that was super helpful. The area itself is perfectly located near the beaches, handful of restaurants, liquor store, gas station, etc. Quick drive/Uber into downtown Newport. Pat and Mitch were so welcoming and were quick to respond to our questions and needs. This place is highly recommended!! Will def keep Pat and Mitch in mind for our next visit.","Rhode Island"

The location is right on the water - just go down the stairs (and there's a very nice seating area with a fire pit too!)  The living room and master bedroom both have the most amazing view - windows on three sides.  The living room has a very comfortable couch from which you can see the water and there's a very well-equipped kitchen and convenient powder room also on the main floor. The two bedrooms are downstairs, and the bathroom is quite large - with lots of towels and soap and shampoo/conditioner.  The house is not really on a street, more of a walkway, so it's very quiet, but the parking is just steps away, so no inconvenience at all.  The house was also very clean, the kitchen cupboards had coffee and tea and there were even paper towels. There's also a dishwasher and a washer / dryer (we didn't need it, but nice to know it was there).
Katy was very prompt in responding and answered all our questions, and there were very good instructions in the house.   The self-check in was convenient because we didn't know exactly when we were going to arrive.  Providence is very close, and Newport and the wineries were all under an hour away, but you really feel far away from it all because of the house's location.  5 stars all around!  We will be back as soon as we can.  Thank you Katy!","Rhode Island"

My experience staying in the space wasn’t what I expected. Make sure you talk to the host the day before!! Lots of miscommunication and had to contact Airbnb to get through to our host/cohost. We booked a room with a double bed and air mattress but it wasn’t brought over.  They then had us move the twin mattress out of another room down really narrow steep stairs to our room. In the morning, they asked for the mattress back.. while my brother was still sleeping on it.  They waited until we left for the day to replace it with an air mattress, which is what we wanted originally and great! The whole thing was just super convoluted and frustrating to deal with after a long trek. 

The rooms are spacious and good if you’re a group on a budget. The home is largely unfinished but it’s really stylish where they have completed.. but it’s more budget than comfort!","Rhode Island"

The owner of the restaurant owns the apartment and he was really friendly and nice - even offered to deliver us food to the apartment. Easy parking right behind the building and outstanding communication from Mike - our host. He explained everything really clearly and takes pride in what he does. We were there on a Friday night and the only downside was the noise from Federal Hill nightlife - which is also a positive if you want a place right in the middle of the best area for true Providence culture. So many great restaurants near by it was hard to choose. Overall a great stay with a terrific host.","Rhode Island"

I was traveling to Providence to meet my sister who was attending an orientation for students accepted at Brown. I was not able to be there Saturday night and she had never stayed in an airbnb alone. She was nervous initially so I had been sending her screenshots of all the wonderful reviews about Michael and his place.   After she met Michael she texted that he was “super nice and helpful”. He helped her figure out a place to grab a bite for dinner. Unfortunately I did not have the pleasure of meeting Michael because of all the issues with missed connections. However, my stepmother was able to catch a red-eye and stayed at Michael’s place Sunday night.  She described her stay as “excellent” and stated he was an “incredibly accommodating” host.  Sometimes life doesn’t go as planned and I am so grateful for Michael’s flexibility and kindness.  Thank you so much for making this easy for my family. Hopefully someday I can stay at your place and say thank you in person.","Rhode Island"

Like another reviewer said it didn't occur to me that having no A/C could be an issue. I don't know about the weather the rest of the year but having no A/C through the heat wave that we were in was uncomfortable even though Wen provided fans in each bedroom as well as one in the living area. 
You should take advantage of the off street parking Wen provides since Providence doesn't allow overnight street parking (ticket).","Rhode Island"

I will never forget this quite surreal scene: we sat on her porch overlooking the new england lake , had a heart felt conversation while having this hearty and authentic chinese breakfast ... pictures are nicer online for most of airbnb , but for lifen and dan’s lake house, pictures cant do the justice, you have to come, see, listen, smell and breathe.

Whether you’re a group of people wanting to go out and party in Newport, looking for a quieter trip or, a couple of gal pals looking for a mix of both like we were, this is the spot. The place itself is gorgeous and soothing. It is both minimalist and cozy, sporting two warm fireplaces, an amazing sound system, two great living rooms to lounge in, 2.5 amazing bathrooms and a great backyard. The bedrooms are so cozy, the washer/dryer is conveniently located. Frankie was the best host - he stocked the fridge with beverages, left the BEST recommendations on places to eat, he let us use his grill and was there whenever we needed him but never in the way. Frankie is genuinely a hospitable person and it really shines through. He just wants you to have the best time. He has a precious dog, Johnny, who stays away if you don’t love dogs. The place is a totally manageable 20-25 minute walk from the heart of downtown. We took Uber’s from bars that were about $5-$10. It is totally worth it to stay at such a luxurious and amazing place.

What you see in the picture is the majority of this inside space.  There is no closet, no inside chair or any other place to put things.  On the wall not shown in the picture there is a sink, face mirror, small fridge on floor and small microwave on top of it.  There is also a bathroom with a toilet and small shower. There is dim overhead lighting and the one lamp shown in the picture.  
However, to be fair during a nice day there is a very lovely outside deck with a table and chairs, grill, and a peak of Narragansett Bay in an inviting neighborhood.  It is a short downhill walk to the bay.","Rhode Island"

The neighborhood is peaceful and quiet, yet the views, the setting and the proximity to things to do make for a great getaway. The hosts, Sheila and Mark, are friendly and warm, yet give guests space. Tiverton and nearby Little Compton are the perfect place for time away -- a number of things to do (galleries, beaches, walks, a few shops and restaurants), yet not commercial or crowded.

My flights there and back were delayed and Allan was more then accommodating to my needs.  Also, he noticed there were no coffee pods and brought them on the first day, which was much appreciated as I was leaving around 7am each day.  Saturday night can get a bit loud outside with the performance theatre, but does not last very long.  You can sometimes hear chatter outside, but not enough that bothered me.  I was not home too much, but when I was it felt cozy with everything you could possibly need.  The bathroom was large and showerhead high, which is great for the taller folks like me.

The outlets were easily accessible and all electronics were easy to plug in wherever in the room. Also there was adequate lighting in the room. The bed was made and comfortable with enough bedding. There is a window AC in the summer and the heat is on in the winter. This is a great and quiet place to stay. I will stay there again if I should need to.","Rhode Island"

The house has six bedrooms and three bathrooms, one en suite. WiFi is great. Two living rooms, each with its own tv and every amenity you can think of in the kitchen. The porch just off the living room is very nice with a barbecue, picnic table and a couple of chairs. In the garden there is a firepit that my family loved to sit around in the evenings. 2 minute walk to a playground with swings and a full basketball court. The house is about a seven minute ride to Narragansett beach. Maria and Don respond immediately and were very easy to communicate with and helpful whenever something was needed.

The room itself is located at the back corner of the house with terrific cross breezes. It is tiny with just enough room for the bed but is adorably appointed and comfortable with pretty painted pictures, quilts and fresh roses. The bed was firm and super comfortable. 
We had the misfortune to be sharing the second floor with loud drinking neighbors who kept me up most of the night. 
However, in the morning our host switched our room to the front room on the second floor which was much larger and located away from the bathroom. I would recommend the front room room in the future or the room on the first floor with the private bath.

This location is fantastic and I jumped at the opportunity when available. There are many restaurants/pubs/bars and historical markers within a minute(s) walk. Parking in Newport can be a nightmare during the summer, but we had no issues at all.  
The apartment was very clean and spacious. There was even a bottle of wine waiting for us when we arrived which is such a kind and simple gesture, but goes a long ways! The kitchen was spacious with a full sized refrigerator and oven. All spaces were very clean and nicely decorated. When we arrived, another couple was going into the apartment (within the building) and the gentleman carried my wife's bag up to our location which was incredibly thoughtful. This just set the tone for our whole visit!    
My wife was not a fan of Newport before this visit, but only because she was sick of hearing me talk about it for so many years. When we left Newport, my wife was as sad about it as I was and she remarked to me: ""I love Newport, Rhode Island""! 
Thank you Jim for helping make this a memorable trip!

When we arrived, 2 of the beds were unmade and 1 was already slept in. Furthermore, all the towels were dirty and on the floor which we had to wash ourselves. There was also dog hair all over the apartment and ants were in the kitchen. There were dirty dishes in the sink and the outside garbage was already overflowing. Lastly. there was minimal air conditioning in the house.  I would not recommend staying here.","Rhode Island"

Starting with Diane, the most wonderful host.  Was always available to me no matter what question I had while making me feel like her home was my home the entire time.  Very professional attitude, extremely organized and thorough, Diane is simply a special host.  The home is absolutely amazing.  Views of the ocean made morning sunrises truly unforgettable.  This trip was inspired by my boyfriend's birthday and was an awesome excuse to get a small group of friends and family together.  I knew from the moment I walked in and saw numerous different mermaids all over the home that I knew it was meant to be all along.  The bathrooms alone were one of the highlights to the stay! Soft sheets, fireplace, granite island in the kitchen while watching friends enjoying the fireplace.  What more can you ask for? This house will NOT disappoint.

We have stayed at a number of AirBNBs and had a number of positive, mediocre, and even regrettable experiences, but Sally's place was by far the worst AirBNB experience we have ever had.

1) We told Sally in advance over AirBNB message that we would be arriving ""by late afternoon"". Unfortunately since we were camping on the day of arrival, we didn't have phone service to tell Sally we would be late. We arrived at Sally's at 8:30PM, tired and wanting to use the shower or tub that Sally had advertised to wash off sunscreen, sweat, and bug repellant. Sally informed us upon arrival that we could not shower for several hours. Her reason was that the guest tub faucet was inoperable and she didn't want to pay to fix it. As for the shower, it was located in a bathroom next to her kitchen, and since she was hosting dinner guests she didn't want us using the shower until several hours later after dinner. When we explained to her that we were uncomfortable without showering, she added that if we had come earlier we could have showered and that she wanted her ""peace"" during dinner. Sally became visibly upset and was rude and spiteful in her mannerisms and actions. She made us feel unwelcome. Unfortunately since we had nowhere else to stay and Sally's home is located in a sketchy part of Providence we were forced to stay, dirty and uncomfortable without shower access. Since we were paying customers, it is sad that Sally did not provide us with the promised amenities. Advertised amenities in an AirBNB are not contingent on guest arrival time or the whims of a host to entertain friends.

2) The second problem was with Sally's driveway. Without prior notice, upon arrival Sally told us that we would have to park in her driveway overnight since street parking was forbidden overnight, and that we would have to wake up by 9AM to move our car from her one-car-wide driveway so other cars could leave. If this had been advertised in advance we wouldn't have stayed with Sally. Since checkout was not until 11AM, this behavior on Sally's part is despicable. She should either mention this detail in her ad or change the checkout time to 9AM.

3) In the evening, after returning from an uncomfortable, itchy night walking around Providence, Becca slipped and nearly fell on an unsafe, slippery rug in the bedroom. Sally should pay the money to put rubber mats under her rugs to ensure her guests' safety.

4) Sally claimed in her ad that our guest bedroom was extremely private.  This was not the case. In the morning, we found that next door to our room there was a man watching television with the door open. I am quite sure he could hear our conversations in the guest bedroom.

Overall, our stay with Sally was an extreme disappointment. We wouldn't stay there again if you paid us.","Rhode Island"

We enjoyed the artwork and original photos all around the house. Every touch was so unique. 

The location of the home was perfect. You can walk about five minutes and be right by the water in Jamestown or at one of the local restaurants. We barely used our car during our stay.

I spent almost a week here, using it as a home base to explore a good chunk of eastern Rhode Island, and it seemed that every place I wanted to visit was conveniently within 20 or so minutes of this rental. I loved the ease of being able to check myself in, and as a massive introvert, I greatly appreciated the privacy and space that I was allowed by my hosts! That’s not to say, however, that their communication was not fantastic. They made it clear that they were available if I needed anything and sent messages leading up to and during my trip to touch base and to provide useful information, including a very helpful photograph showing me exactly what to look for and where to park when I arrived! The unit itself was impeccably clean and wonderfully comfortable, and I appreciated the little touches left for me: coffee and tea for the Keurig, a few snack bars, some brochures advertising restaurants and things to do. The outdoor patio – also very private! – is a beautiful little touch and a nice place to watch chipmunks, birds, and the resident groundhog that crossed my path several times! I would definitely recommend this well-equipped apartment to anyone looking to stay in the area.","Rhode Island"

Something to share -- this listed as a ""two-bedroom"" suite but in reality it is a common space with a staircase that partially divides it into two areas. One of these areas has a microwave, keurig, and table. (This is your indoor dining area.) There are no bedroom doors. This is in the basement of the hosts' home. We had a wonderful time, as the beach is close (15 min walk, 2 min drive) and so easy accessible with the parking pass. The outdoor space is beautiful, but your stay is very dependent on the weather. Simple space; wonderful hosts.","Rhode Island"

My husband, our kids (4,2), and my parents stayed in the house and found the space very comfortable. I was initially nervous about having ungated stairs, but the kids did great on the carpet. They loved the board games & Netflix available in the living room (for our one rainy evening) and the grown-ups even completed 2 jigsaw puzzles, something we hadn’t done in years! The backyard was great for eating lunch/dinner and relaxing after a day in the sun and we used the outdoor shower daily, even when we weren’t covered in sand from the beach! The location was great for a walk to nearby stores and restaurants, and the beach; we certainly got our exercise! The kids loved sitting on the front porch and watching the workmen paving the street during our stay. Otherwise, the neighborhood was very quiet. Deborah was super helpful and responsive when we needed a few things during the week. We look forward to hopefully staying here again in the future!","Rhode Island"

We were admittedly needy with check-in and check out times and Benjamin was more than happy to be flexible as we arrived later than expected and needed to keep some luggage within the unit after check-out.

Her house had easy parking with a double driveway, on a safe street, with only an 8 minute drive to the heart of Newport. It was the perfect layout for an Airbnb, with a comfy living room, bedroom, bathroom, large kitchen with a dinette, and a private back porch. The central air was perfect being that it was over 90 degrees out – definitely comfortable inside. Her space is extremely clean, and we really felt at home for our stay. 

One thing to note for others regarding getting to town: A bunch of reviews on here said that they took a $5 uber to Newport, so we thought we were going to be doing that for our trip. However, every time we looked to get an uber, it was more like a $12 uber ride each way (even though it's only 8 min away.) We ended up driving ourselves every time, and parking in the Newport Visitor's Center garage. This was definitely the cheaper option, as it was around $12 for the whole DAY to park there.

Beware however of the steep stairs, sloped walls on the top floor (standing up required some attention not to hit the head), and if you are sensitive to the bed quality, polyester sheets and pillows might be a bit hard to deal with.

Would however recommend.","Rhode Island"

It’s walking distance to shops, cafes, and restaurants. It’s also close to Cliff Walk and a short drive to downtown Newport. We had no issues with the host who was very sweet and welcoming. It is an older home with all the quirks: floors do creak, the doors on our bedroom and the bathrooms were a bit loud when opening and closing. Be aware there is no A/C (it was my fault for not reading the details but we didn’t really have issues with this since there was a window fan in our room). The check in and check out process was easy. I think the only thing that bothered us was that the bed was really loud whenever we moved. There was one other couple staying in the bedroom next to us while we were there and we barely heard or saw them despite having a shared bathroom. Overall great value, a safe spot to lay our heads and keep our things.","Rhode Island"

She was always very quick to reply and happy to help with anything you need and provided great recommendations for restaurants and fun things to do in the city!
I felt very safe here- there is off-street parking and beautiful garden/outside sitting area with lights at night and keypad to enter the building. The full bed is very comfortable, the kitchen is stocked with silverware, pots/pans, dishware if you're staying long like me. The bathroom has a full shower tub with hair dryer, there is a table that is perfect for doing work on a laptop and eating meals, and there is also a stand alone closet with hangers and plenty of space for clothes/shoes. There is a nice air conditioning unit and ceiling fan too. The place is very clean!

If you’re “glamping” this might be what your looking for. If you’re planning a relaxing get away, pay the extra money and step up to something you look forward to sitting in. I personally wouldn’t recommend this home, however, it’s all a matter of personal perspective.","Rhode Island"

The area is really quiet, the bed comfortable, the house really clean, and the hosts fantastic. No complaints at all! This curly-haired gal appreciated the diffuser attached to the blow dryer. It honestly felt like we were staying in a 5 star hotel but with better hospitality. :)

Breakfast was delicious and we felt very at home. We'd definitely go back again and stay longer.","Rhode Island"

Once in the apartment, we wished we had more time to spend in Newport.  The layout of the apartment is perfect for sharing time with the family and also having privacy.  The kitchen and it's facilities are excellent.  We made wonderful meals as though we were at home.  The heated pool was fun and the weight room was just down the hall, so easy to find our way to working out.  We could not have been more comfortable!  Lots of pillows and very comfortable beds.

"5296",26849780,311115653,2018-08-20,92364886,"Rabia","This was my second visit to Newport, and I had to book this place in a hurry as I made plans last minute with my mom, amidst holiday season! Nonetheless, I incredibly lucked out, as the location is smack in the middle of downtown Newport, and it is as pristine as any other mansion you'd encounter on Bellevue Avenue. It is very close to the Newport Visitors Center and Seastreak Ferry, so very ideal for someone without a car (like me). You can easily take the trolley to the mansions or Cliff Walk, or rideshare in around $7-8 to these locations--the walk would probably be 40 minutes. As for the space itself, it's lavish and gorgeous, with real wood floors both in the bedroom and the private bathroom, and it was impeccable down to the white lace bed spread! There isn't any coffee or tea equipment in the room, but there is a spacious closet, storage space and a sofa with foot stool to stretch one's legs. Lenore greeted me when I arrived (at 2pm--3 hours earlier than check-in) and escorted me to my bedroom. She gave me valuable eatery and travel tips which I ended up incorporating into my trip, and it turned out amazing! She has a beautiful dog as well, though my mom is a little petrified by dogs so I only really met him briefly. I also left my luggage at her place and picked it up much later. In general, I had a great time, it's an ideal downtown location with breathtaking interior, and the basic amenities you'd hope for.","Rhode Island"

It's on a quiet side street, right down the road from the best ice cream (Brickley's) and best cappuccino (Fuel) in Narragansett. 10 minutes to downtown Narragansett, a hop up 1A to the bridges to Jamestown and Newport.  We got to Beavertail lighthouse in under 25 minutes. Check-in was as easy as possible  - keys are on site for whenever you arrive. The gardens were just beautiful, with stands of tiger lilies, hosta, and yarrow lining the drive, and it was pleasant sitting in the back garden, watching the bunnies hop and reading in the shade of the tree.  The house is small but immaculate, open floor plan, obviously been completely renovated. It is NOT one of those typical older beach houses with the awful knotty pine paneling and dark little rooms- everything's clean, spare, modern, and there's lots of natural light. The small dishwasher and top-quality washer/dryer combo were much appreciated. My only ""notes"" for future travelers are - the two queen beds are on the firm side, just FYI, and the futon in the living room (which folds down very easily, and sheets and quilt are provided) will accommodate sleepers not over 6 feet (length is limited by armrests).  The AC unit works great to cool the house on hot days. We thought it was a great value for the price compared to a lot of other area rentals (we've been renting in this area for 20 years).","Rhode Island"

No complications arranging entry into the property. The accommodations were accurately depicted and there were even a few pleasant touches that I found thoughtful from the amenities, the stocked fridge, and the Keurig machine. The location was peaceful and quiet. The bed is comfortable, and the bathroom is well appointed with quality towels and amenities. I will definitely stay with France again. We unfortunately did not meet in person as my schedule was very busy, but I anticipate future opportunities to rectify that.","Rhode Island"
"5391",26104461,342795103,2018-10-29,218047547,"Shelly","We stayed here for 3 nights in late October. The location was great (and would be ideal during the summer especially!), apartment was clean, and check in was easy. The space is super cozy as other reviewers have noted, but perfectly fine as a home base for those spending their days out and about. If the sofa bed is pulled out, there is very little room to move about so I would not recommend this to groups larger than 4 or 5.

However, guests considering staying here during the cooler months should be aware that the apartment gets incredibly cold and doesn’t seem to have central heating. The bedrooms seem well-insulated and stayed relatively warm throughout our stays (and down comforters helped). The living room, however, stayed chilly. Two space heaters were provided, but could not be used at the same time without flipping the circuit breaker. We reached out to the hosts about this to see if there was a trick to using them simultaneously but unfortunately never heard back. 

Overall, this was a perfectly fine place to sleep and use as a home base and would be lovely during the summer, but certainly could be improved for future guests. I would not recommend staying here during cold temperatures.","Rhode Island"

We got cozy in the living room to either read in one of the comfortable reading chairs or to watch tv on the couch (on our laptop. There isn't a tv.) I did morning yoga in the wood-floor spare room, looking out to the garden. Upstairs, the bedroom is simple, clean, airy and water-themed--relaxing.

House was clean and contained all previously-arranged extra amenities, including two cribs and high chairs. Within a half-hour upon arrival, Gina met us to explain all features and quirks of the property. Before and during our stay, she was a superb communicator.

As is typical with all oceanfront homes, something always requires maintenance. A few light bulbs and switches were inoperative; Gina quickly brought over new light bulbs so we could replace one or two ourselves. Only one of the four TV's worked properly; apparently, there was a problem with the cable company's modems. Wi-Fi, on the other hand, was fine. The remodeled kitchen and master bath were appreciated by all. Also appreciated were the beach chairs, beach umbrella, boogie boards and beach cart to walk everything to the nearby Captain Roger Wheeler State Beach.

This was our first stay in an AirBnB. Our grown children and their spouses, on the other hand, have stayed in many. All agree that Away Wee Go House was the perfect spot to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary

We rented the 1st and 3rd floor so have a perspective on comparing the units. The 1st floor was very comfortable with a separate living room and spacious kitchen area. We appreciated having the extra space in the living room -- which we did not have on the 3rd floor. The 3rd floor seemed best for the basics of sleeping and getting ready. The kitchen provides extra room, but we had no need for it during our stay. There is not a comfortable seating area due to the slope of the roof, but we did not spend as much time in that unit. Also, because of the layout of the 3rd floor there was a need to have large fans in the rooms to try and circulate the cool air from the A/C unit in the front. It was a hot weekend, so they were all going full blast, so the ""background"" hum was a little noisy.

This was my third summer coming to Rhode Island for the New England Regional Championships and hotel rooms are always out of sight, so I decided to take a quick look and was surprised to find something like The Second Landing, which seemed like it would work for us. I decided to give it a shot, and am so glad that I did! Delores was very responsive and communicative both before and during our stay. The apartment was extremely clean, comfortable, and spacious, in a quiet neighborhood. So much better than a hotel. I loved the character of the house, and Delores has added the extra finishing touches to make one feel right at home there. She event went as far as to provide some staples in the refrigerator, which was a huge time saver during a very busy weekend. 
Fly and I loved our stay at The Second Landing and hope to book it again the next time we are in the area competing!","Rhode Island"

We were in a position that we had to spend a lot of time indoors... and without regular tv it was impossible.  There were no instructions how to use the tv. We told them we would pay for the night we spent there if they could refund the rest.  They refused... I believe this was false advertising and was very disappointed. 

Also... it would have been nice to have at least a bar of soap and box of tissues...little amenities don’t cost much but mean a lot!  

Bathroom sink area very tiny... it does have a med cabinet.  Place was decorated very nicely and clean.  We felt the immediate area was a little rough and we were a little uncomfortable with that aspect although only 6 minutes driving time to broadway with lots of restaurants etc. Also, outside noice was a bit of an issue.

You’re about 45 minutes from Newport (in the off-season when we went at least) and about 20 minutes from Newport. We went to the #1 rated restaurant in providence called Los Andes and it was amazing. Only 15 minutes from the house.  And in Newport you can buy a 5 mansion tour and split them up into two different days. The Cliff Walk is an amazing hike along the water while getting to see all the mansions along the way. Easton’s beach also has some good lobster rolls and clam chowder and the beach is clean and relaxing.

Anyway, this was a great house to stay at in between Providence and Newport and I’d definitely recommend for a nice 4-5 day weekend trip!","Rhode Island"

The fridge was turned up to 40 degrees and we didn’t realize this until we checked the fridge later and realized none of our food was cold. The fridge also isn’t hooked up to a water line so there was no ice.  The grill that is pictured is not the grill that is actually at the house. The grill that is actually at the home has a handle that is falling off. When we went to turn the grill on, half of it didn’t light. The toaster was too small to fit regular sized bagels and the oven didn’t seem to heat up food appropriately. The faucet on the sink was also falling off. Other then the appliance issues it was a good place to stay. The beds were neatly made and the sheets were clean. There were only two rolls of toilet paper so we had to go out and buy some. Very close to downtown about a 5 min drive. Great place for a short stay if you don’t plan on cooking.","Rhode Island"

The AirBnB is in a great location for people visiting Providence for either Brown or RISD. It is in a cute old apartment building halfway up the hill to the Brown campus and right up the street from a pretty good Korean/Japanese restaurant. Whole Foods is about a ten-fifteen minute walk up a very nice street.

The apartment is comprised of a small living room, bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen. We liked the kitchen the best--this is a good AirBnB for people intending to make food during their stay. The living room and bedroom were fine, as shown in the photos. 

This may just be about my own taste, but we did not feel that the utmost efforts had been made to prepare the apartment for our stay. Small details, such as un-emptied trash in the kitchen and toothbrushes on the sink, made us feel as though were were invading a little bit. I have usually stayed in AirBnBs that are more neutral in terms of personal stuff lying around. Of course they are not meant to be hotel rooms, but I thought it was worth noting.","Rhode Island"

The host continuously lied to us and refused to provide what was listed in the listing and made excuses. The apartment was dirty, dusty, had used razor blades in the bathroom sink. It wasn’t ready for us when we arrived at 11 pm despite the check in time being 3 pm. I have never had such a bad experience","Rhode Island"

"5582",7734177,335941366,2018-10-13,53765799,"Michael","The location is convenient to historic downtown or the Navy base which was perfect for us.  The home itself is an historic home, modern but perhaps in an 80's way.  As is clearly explained, you are sharing the location with other guests.  We were on the second floor which had two bedrooms and a shared bathroom off of the living room of the second floor.  It would be perfect if you were a family needing two rooms (you would need to pay for two) or perhaps traveling with another couple.  We had different guests in the other room both nights of our stay, but they could not have been nicer in our brief interactions.   We liked the ""grab it yourself"" style of the kitchen with coffee, muffins, toast, juice in the morning. It was easy and simple and got us going in the morning.  Walter is very nice and had a map of the area to help us get our bearings; he keeps the place clean and was attentive to what we might need.  Boru is a funky and delicious noodle shop in the nearby downtown and the White Horse Tavern hosted George Washington and can serve you lunch or dinner as well.","Rhode Island"

We arrived at night and were glad to find some snacks we could eat before going to bed. The apartment appeared to be very cosy and comfortable, it had everything we needed.
Bristol is very nice, we enjoyed seeing sites around and walking in Blithewold Gardens and Arboretum even though, I guess, it wasn't the right season for it yet.
Location is pretty convenient. Our first day in Bristol was at Easter and we woke up pretty late, but still we could find a supermarket (Seabra Foods) that was just 8 min drive from the apartment and still open, so we could buy what we needed.
During our stay we visited colleges in Cambridge, Worcester and Providence which are pretty near and easily reachable, at least if you are using a car.","Rhode Island"

House was perfect for our party of 5 adults attending the Newport Folk Festival. 1st floor common space was a perfect size to relax. Kitchen had all necessary amenities. Check in was easy and smooth. 

Given other reviews, downstairs shower isn’t great, but gets the job done if you have too many to all use the 2nd floor. 

Great place, I would stay again.","Rhode Island"

We had no problems, but we also made sure not to leave anything in the car over night. We also did not feel like this was a neighborhood that we could take a walk through. The place was very clean and tidy. It did however not look exactly like the pictures. The blue chairs had been replaced with black ones. The pictures also gave off an entirely different feel to how the layout actually is. It was though the pictures had been taken with a “pretty” filter. This is also a Home that has been split into two separate apts. we never saw our neighbors but we could hear them above us. Overall. This place is worth the value.","Rhode Island"

Oddly, the electricity was still working (refrigerator, air conditioning) just not the lights. The circuit breakers showed the fuses were all fine.  We called Jim & Kim but received no response (they were on vacation which we didn’t find out until they eventually contacted us).  Additionally, it’s not mentioned anywhere but there are no locks on the only door to barn (a sliding glass door) only a piece of wood to wedge in the door.  And even with the wood in the door, the door can still be opened a little.  Lights out with no explanation, no lock on the door, and the owners off on vacation kind of made my wife nervous to stay there.  I contacted Lisel who is very prompt with her responses and she must’ve gotten Kim to finally call us, who basically said that she’s off on vacation and doesn’t know what could be wrong with the lights.  She offered to send someone out the next day if it continues.  She also asked multiple times if we were confused about how to turn the lights on which I found a little rude.  
The lights went on and off a few more times throughout the night creating an uneasy first night on what was supposed to be a relaxing vacation.  My wife & I decided to look for a hotel to switch to but none were available.  We inevitably cancelled our trip short because we simply didn’t feel comfortable at the barn.","Rhode Island"

I was wrong, the space was warm and welcoming with all the amenities: snacks, drinks, a bottle of wine, extra towels, an electric fireplace, etc. The owners thought of everything, which made for a perfect stay. I am from the area, so I wanted something centrally located. It's a straight shot from here to Newport, Bristol, Tiverton or Island Park.

The weather was too cool to use the unheated pool for us, but the views of the lake over the garden were great! We saw a deer once on the lawn which was a treat. The owners are very responsive and very accommodating when we needed to purchase a few things to make our stay more comfortable, like paper towels and a few kitchen/grill utensils. Grill works well and appliances and A/C all work great! No Laundry on property so we had to go to a nearby laundromat to do our laundry mid-week. We liked that this unit has two king beds. The interior design is excellent. Bring/buy bottled water if you like filtered water. Bring your own shampoo and conditioner as well. About the only thing that could be improved is the fit of all the interior doors as they rub against the carpet and are loud and difficult if you have a little one sleeping. Also the screen on one sliding door had a big rip in it. But we actually loved the sliding doors that let lots of natural light and breeze in. Would stay again if we get the chance!

Karine was very nice, reactive, comprehensive and helpful (she is also French so it was even easier for us to communicate), among others she met us at the bus station to avoid us to walk with our luggages in the (cold) night.

The house was so pretty, we felt like in an American/Newport dream: nice street with wooden colored houses and American flags, porch with chairs you can use to comfortably drink your coffee, warm house with plants and books, comfy bed and bathroom...and the cuttest little garden to eat your breakfast in... The night was not cheap (for us), but it was absolutely not comparable with our other Airbnb reservations. It totally worth it, it's a very excellent quality/price ratio :)

Karine showed us places/streets to visit and gave us local maps: it was great because we had only one day in Newport and we were able to see the best of it. We love it, we would like to visit again, and take more time to relax and enjoy the place!","Rhode Island"

Her taste is traditional and quirky .  Very spacious apt which I loved and room for everyone to relax . Very functional kitchen with lots of cupboard space and a grt coffee maker . Exceptionally clean throughout!!!! 
Quiet residential street with beautiful traditional houses many of which are being renovated.  Uber or Lyft is the best way to get about nearby but there is also a bus around the corner about every 20 mins into town. Found Stop n Shop on our second day and it has everything incl a pharmacy but alcohol can be bought in liquor stores only . Everyone we met out and about were so friendly and helpful and the fact that Norwegian Airways fly direct into Providence has opened up this whole area for tourism now!!!

Easy walk to wonderful breakfast coffee shop (can see from deck) and many dining places from diners to upscale.  Parking is across the street but dedicated.

I would say that it is pretty expensive for the accommodations provided - we paid for two and only received one towel, the blanket on the bed was too small for the actual size of the bed, and overall the accommodations were pretty mediocre. It's good if you just need a place to sleep, but for that I could have paid far less. The walls are also extremely thin, and we were woken up by other guests consistently throughout our stay, who did not seem aware of how loud they were being. We ended up buying earplugs, which was fine-- if you are sensitive to sound, you might want to consider preparing accordingly. The location was great, however, and we really got a feel for the Federal Hill neighborhood. Carlos was also great about providing parking for us.","Rhode Island"

I enjoyed walking on the thick wide-plank pine floors so much that I will miss that experience until I get to stay there again when I visit my dad in Jamestown next year. It was very well stocked with all the essentials.  As a matter of fact, I would say this was the best supplied airbnb I have ever stayed in. It also had an enviable Wi-Fi speed even for me, who is from Silicon Valley. It was very convenient to be located downtown, with the well equipped hardware store and the aptly named coffee shop/café “Slice of Heaven,” both worth the trip.  I also loved being able to walk along the water and on the many docks and floats every day.  The hosts were fantastic, immediately available to answer any question I had.","Rhode Island"

The apartment is part of a larger building that also hosted an event during one night of our stay, to which we were graciously invited.  It even had a band - what fun!  But for the majority of our stay the place was very quiet with flowers, deer and birds.   Lots of space inside the apartment.  Two of the beds are in common areas of the house.  While the space was clean, it was in need of basic upkeep attention.  And the locks on the two sliding doors are 2"" x 2"" pieces of wood, which do technically secure the doors from opening but were not what we expected.   Pamela was quickly responsive during our one communication, and the people we met on site were very friendly.

The keyless entry was nice, for we had a large group with us and one key wouldn’t have worked well. There was a nice area out back to sit in (though I do not believe it is Mike’s property).  As we all went to leave for the night, a random man tried to get us all to pay $10 for parking our cars there, so watch out for the scammers. We did not pay and did not get our cars towed or anything to that extent. The only issue we had was reaching Mike before the stay, but he explained it was due to how many messages he received daily because he owns other properties he rents. Once we got his actual phone number, it wasn’t an issue, but the property was not as close to down town Providence as we thought.","Rhode Island"

It is however an older property and some of the facilities including the main bathroom are not as modern as we would have preferred. Also be aware that your hosts and their daughters do normally live at the house. They moved out just for the week that we were there and as a result many of their personal things were still there when we checked in- food in the kitchen, soap, toothpaste etc in the bathroom and clothes in the bedrooms.

James was always super helpful and quick to respond, for example when I didn't see the key lock box right away at my arrival, he immediately responded to my call. The apartment is stylishly and ecclectically furnished and quiet. I stayed there for three weeks to do research at the JCB library, which is a ten minute walk away, so it's extremely convenient. Working at the apartment was also comfortable, there is a table to sit at and though you sometimes hear people from the other units in the house it is nice and quiet. Cafés are in the same direction in walking distance and a Whole Foods is a ten minute walk away into the other direction. So even without a car it's a great place to stay. James also gave great recommendations for places to see and cafés and restaurants to go to. I recommend it 100% percent and would come back any time!","Rhode Island"

I was going to visit my college age son and was looking for a place walking distance to Brown University. The location was 0.7 miles from his apartment off Thayer Street. Despite being in the rooftop with some sloping ceilings the space is roomy enough for one or two. The special quality of this place is all of the extras she has thought of...ironing board and iron, yoga mat, well-stocked kitchen items and snacks, fridge, microwave and toaster. I also was not expecting such a great bath and shower in such an old home. Light switches and electronics are well labeled so no fumbling with all of the remotes to get the tv turned on. Odile was also willing to work with me on my arrival and departure times which didn't quite coincide with check in and check out. Thanks again!","Rhode Island"

Host - Jason had this place prepped for me on very short notice, everything was sparkling cleans and stocked with everything needed. Communication was short and sweet, which is perfect considering my staying there for almost two months, makes you feel like it's your place and not have to check-in with the host every few days.

It is, without a doubt, the most aesthetically stunning and comfortable place we’ve stayed to date. The open-air layout retains the old-church feeling with stained glass windows and original foundation intact - and there are enough bedrooms and quiet nooks to find quiet time if you’re staying with a big group.

To top it off, Alex (the manager) is awesome. Super friendly, accommodating, and thoughtful. The beds are exceptionally comfortable and uber fares averaged about $4.50 to get to downtown Denver.

Amazing restaurants (especially breakfast places!) and dispensaries are easily within walking distance. The apartment itself felt very bright and open and was spotless.

We had a large group and there was plenty of space for all of us.  The guys enjoyed sitting around the large dining room table playing games. One of the living rooms (there was more than one) was perfect for lounging. Children had plenty of space to play. The private backyard was perfect for drinking our morning coffee and relaxing.
Beautiful mirrors throughout the house...huge vases were part of the decor as well. All in all it was beautiful!! I certainly will give 5 stars and recommend this place for a large group.
Suggestion...maybe a larger water heater would be good. We ran out of hot water the first night. But then the second evening we spaced our showers and we didn't run out again. Also the bathroom lock on the second floor needs to be fixed, it did not lock. 
However, these were minor issues...we really enjoyed our stay and will consider it in the future if we find ourselves back in that area!","Denver"

I arrived late and left early so I basically just slept there.

(Be very careful with parking though - there is only street parking and it requires you to be up early and really READ THE FINE PRINT.) There are plants everywhere in the space, so many wonderful books on the shelves, a great mountain tapestry hanging on the wall, and a fantastic view of the city. She offers fresh fruit and cool beverages in the fridge, and a wide variety of them, too! Her space is very clean and homey - all the stress of my day melted away when I set foot inside. She does have two parakeets who are delightful, but may wake you in the morning. Also, she does not, at the moment, offer a bed in her space. The fold out mattress isn't quite big enough for two and neither is the chaise lounge. Other than that though, she really makes you feel at home and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay with her :)","Denver"

Mostly only chose this place because it was last minute business trip and an emergency at first I loved that the host was so helpful in me getting the house, but when I showed up my stay things just got worse and worse as the days went by. As soon as arrived it smelled so horrible I went and bought multiple air plug ins just to help it smell better! Shortly after arriving I seen multiple bugs.... not even your typical ants, but roaches and beetles! The house was never spotless and cleaned as described and shown in the pictures! I had paid a cleaning fee of $40 prior to the stay. I was there for 4 days total and I had to use towels to as floor mats for the shower and to catch water coming from the shower. I had also changed the sheets multiple times and she shortly after requested $200 more dollars just to wash the extra linens and towels I had used. I feel very played and taken advantage of — I gave this woman over $600 for my stay and she requesting more money from stains on the mattress that she claims came from me. I will admit the linens were definitely dirty, but I know for a fact I didn’t stain the mattress. Due to the fact that I did use the towels and linens and the washer/dryer that was suppose to be available, but wasn’t— I had asked to see if my check out time could be scheduled two hours after her requested time so I would be able to wash the extras I have used (which I normally do anyways when a washer/dryer is available), when staying at an Airbnb. She claimed she had to get the house ready for the next guest.. come to find out the next guest wouldn’t be showing up until next month! I also believe that a cleaning fee is a cleaning fee for a reason and should count towards whatever including me using the extra linens and towels. I am not understanding why the host had these extras and is upset that I used them!? Not only that, but she expected me to call every time I needed something (like sheets changed etc) but I am very busy young man as I was there for business and didn’t really feel it was necessary, especially if I had a working washer/dryer as listed in amenities! I have read multiple reviews from the hosts previous guest, pertaining these same issues and more after my stay that I wish I would’ve seen beforehand. I would have definitely stayed at a hotel and had a much better experience. The gag is how she is trying to make me out to be the bad person when I honestly did...","Denver"

The washer-dryer was easy to use, and she even supplies ""free and clear"" detergent that won't irritate sensitive skin.  So incredibly considerate! 

The only note (not even a criticism, but a thing to ""be aware"" of) is that it is an old building, so it does make some ""old building"" noises. It sounded at times like their might be someone on the roof, but it is just the building settling. Nothing to worry about!","Denver"

Paul was very hospitable, going out of his way to make sure I had everything that I needed to be comfortable during my stay. He also thoughtfully provided complimentary coffee and tea, beer, and La Croix carbonated water to enjoy during my stay. He even had some travel brochures ready for various places that I mentioned I was interested in visiting, as well as  provided laundry detergent and a roll of quarters so that I could make use of the building's laundry facilities.

For those who might be curious, in my opinion, Paul's place is a bit too far to walk to a lot of the popular attractions in Denver. Unless you've rented or brought a bike with you, be prepared to drive or take an Uber/Lyft/bus to most places. Not a deal-breaker for me, just something to be aware of.

Overall I really enjoyed my stay at Paul's place. I would highly recommend his place if you're looking for a place in this price range and I would choose to stay here again under similar circumstances.","Denver"

His place is within walking distance of some really amazing restaurants and Gary provides you with some menus when you arrive to help choose where to go. I really recommend his place if you are looking for a location that is near downtown. For hiking you do have to drive a couple hours, but Gary was great about pointing us in the direction of some close by mountains.
Also, Gary and Buster were amazing with our dog. Buster is the goofiest, most friendly dog around! So if you are bringing a pet, this is a great option.","Denver"

The guest suite is the front of their beautiful home, so to check in, we walked right up the front steps and there was a key code on the front door!  We loved having breakfast on the peaceful front porch.  There was no one above or below us.  We were always able to park directly in front of the house.  The guest suite includes a spacious living room with pull-out couch, a lovely dining room that has a mini fridge, microwave, and coffee pot (they provided ground coffee, the pot was the type that has a mesh basket and doesn't require filters, and they also provided a selection of tea), a great bedroom with firm comfortable bed and a huge closet, and an enormous luxury bathroom.  The bed sheets were nice and there were ample pillows and towels.  Soap, shampoo, and conditioner were provided.  The decor was lovely - stylish, unique, and modern.  There is a door off the dining room that connects to the hosts' segment of the home and I could occasionally very faintly hear them when I was right next to it.  They thoughtfully run a white noise machine and have curtains over the doors so we had complete privacy.  We rarely ran the air conditioner in the bedroom as Denver cools off at night and opening the windows was very pleasant.  The location is stellar - located in a gorgeous residential neighborhood with spectacular upkeep and very fancy homes (we looked on a real estate web site and were not surprised to learn we were surrounded by million dollar homes).  We were a few miles from major destinations of interest - the Molly Brown house, the museums, and we were just a few blocks from restaurants, ice cream, coffee, and beautiful Washington Park.  The park is enormous.  It has two small lakes with paddle boat and kayak rental options.  Most of the park is not for cars, but pedestrians and cyclists only, with clearly designated lanes.  There is also a lovely garden section.  We enjoyed strolling around the park and the neighborhood every evening.  I have stayed in many Airbnbs and Susan and Matt's home truly exceeded my expectations.  I highly recommend staying here and would happily stay again if back in Denver.","Denver"

There were so many ""homely"" touches that made this such a pleasant stay. Ranging from the throw blanket on the couch, to the well stocked bathroom toiletries, to the magazine rack. Even though we were tourists, we comfortably were able to play ""locals"" by grabbing coffee from the nearby cafe and working from the work desk in the apartment, and sometimes returning early from a night out to hang out on the cozy couch. Bonus points for Jerry recommending a top dining choice. The one improvement would be for the internet to be a bit faster.","Denver"

Scott's home actually sits on the Golf course. Since I am a morning person, I could sit on the deck and watch the sun come up. Picturesque snowcap mountains from the kitchen/dining area were beautiful.

The house is in a great location with plenty to do, eat, and drink within a short walk or drive, and just minutes from downtown, the interstate, etc. We slept 6 comfortably with 2 people in each upstairs bedroom, 1 in the basement, and 1 in the first-floor bedroom.  Joe was incredibly responsive and helpful and provided a ton of recommendations for food and activities. The backyard with ample seating space and yard games was an added bonus! Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer!","Denver"

Only complaint is that the big tv downstairs was pointed towards the ceiling so we didn’t get to use it but we all loved the house! That and the sky light in the master bedroom makes sure you’re awake when the suns up! So, if you want I hit the slopes early or get your morning going, it’s not such a bad thing. Highly recommend if you have a big group. Great hosts.","Denver"

The place was perfect for what we needed. Each day we got an early start. There are plenty of restaurants, bars, breweries, and shops very close by (Favorites: TRVE Brewery, Punch Bowl Social, Sweet Action Creamery, Sputnik). 

We didn’t have our car so we did a ton of walking. It was helpful that the space was centrally located. We even walked to a Rockies game at Coors Field (about 3 miles away). Public bus stops are only a few blocks away. 

Overall, we didn’t have any issues which gave us potential to fully enjoy Denver. This place is highly recommended, and we will definitely book here again soon.","Denver"

Parking is especially difficult to find and expensive around the area during game times. Privately owned parking lots gouge prices significantly during these times as well.

It is perhaps my own fault for not reading some of the comments here more thoroughly, or looking up the area, before booking. But I did not feel safe at all entering or exiting the building. Not only was there a large homeless population, but loud profanity, drugs, and violence, right outside the building. When I returned home the second night, after a long day at a conference, I returned to a major crime scene right in front of the building. Six or seven police cars; an ambulance, and fire truck. I had to walk around the police tape to get to the apartment. I asked someone what had happened. There was a shooting only minutes before.","Denver"

The downstairs/basement area was more spacious and comfortable than the average hotel room, and with better value! My only minor complaint is that the downstairs area could get pretty chilly, but the warm beds made it an afterthought. I'm sure this is only a seasonal issue.","Denver"

The amenities provided were everything from cooking essentials to baby diapers!  The hosts most definitely took the time to help maximize our experience.  The area has some great restaurants and bars and is a quick Uber to Lodo or other places you may want to travel in Denver. We had a few questions for Kevin and he was sure to respond quickly.  The rooftop deck is very nice but unfortunately had no provided shade options and was mostly unusable in the 90 degree heat of midday. It was great in the mornings and evenings/night.

"6438",13914386,312110719,2018-08-22,2012900,"Ginny","Perfect location. This is a short walk from Larimer Lounge and a super cool area with bars, restaurants, etc.  A 5 minute Lyft to the 38th/Blake train station which goes to the airport.

This is a unit within the house (with 3-4 total units I think). There’s a separate bedroom, living room, small kitchen, and small bath. The space was immaculate, the exterior landscaping was beautiful, and there’s a nice courtyard in the back. The living room has a comfy clean sofa and a small dinette. The place is flush with windows which is splendid. 

Things to know: The bedroom is just big enough for the bed, so it’s (necessarily) pushed against the wall on one side. Worth noting for older couples or anyone with mobility issues. 

And the bathroom has a smaller than standard tub/shower combo is a pretty tight quarters. On of those where the door opens so far into the bathroom that you have to kind of wiggle around it to shut it behind you. Again, not a big deal for us but might be uncomfortable for a larger guest and/or someone with mobility issues. 

If there are just 2-3 people and no one’s going to be stressed by the tiny bathroom, this is a great Airbnb! The host had all the info for checkin sent automatically; instructions were clear and thorough. I would highly recommend this spot!","Denver"

The place has great value, comfortable for 5 adult men, could be a little crowded with more.  Besides the half bath being connected to the downstairs entry and the full bath downstairs isolated to a bedroom, everyone was pretty happy.  The Nest thermostat was a huge + since the temps from morning and night had drastic differences.  Would definitely stay again.","Denver"

I will say this though, she communicated so efficiently and effectively when she discovered my last minute schedule adjustments and it really helped smooth the transition...this behavior and forethought is priceless for parents. So we were appreciative from the start.
As for the house itself my wife passed on the following...that it was in a great location and the walkability scored a 10 out of 10. The condition of the residence was immaculate and there was NOTHING left to be desired. Furthermore, we have stayed in a number of Airbnb’s and my wife ranked this place as #1!!! Overall an incredible place with a wonderful host in an epic location. Guess you can’t beat that! Thanks Sandy!","Denver"

I arrived very late at night due to a flight delay and it was no problem with the private keyless entrance. My partner arrived late the next night and again, easy entrance. Plus it’s nice not to worry about a key.  If you are looking to be in Denver but not downtown in the hustle and bustle, I thought the neighborhood she lived in was a nice alternative. I took the bus downtown one day and it was about a 5-7 min walk to the bus stop and and 15-20 min bus ride. If you’re not into public transportation, driving was about 10-15 minutes to/from downtown. Otherwise she lives very close to a few parks and a street lined with restaurants, bars, cafes, shops, groceries, etc. Overall, a lovely place to stay!","Denver"

However, upon arrival, we found the large glass window on the back door totally shattered. We also found a note from the cleaning person advising that she/he notified the owner of the situation and that it was caused by a previous guest. The window was unsecured and there was no attempt to secure it. There was also no attempt to communicate this issue to us before our arrival, so we were very surprised/concerned to arrive to a home in a new city with a shattered window.  We were unable to contact Daniel because he did not have cell service, and we did not hear from him about the situation until after we departed. Aside from this incident, it was a beautiful and quiet home in a nice location.","Denver"

Its walking distance to convenience stores, local shops, bars, restaurants, dispensaries, and more. The Thin Man and Soul Haus were a couple of my favorites nearby. The condo itself is cozy and inviting. If you prefer lots of privacy it may not be the best choice as one bedroom is also the front entrance and there is only one bathroom. For me and my 3 friends it was perfect and I dont think we could have chose a better place. Check in was easy and this place had everything we needed.","Denver"

The neighborhood is quiet, there is ample street parking and easy access to public transportation. I dare you to try and find a better place to stay for a better price (I don't think you could).","Denver"

"6503",4861034,275226247,2018-06-10,4665755,"Peter","We rented Jon's place for a bachelor party weekend, with 10 guys sleeping there and a few local friends popping in to hang out over the course of the weekend. 

I felt pretty good and had reasonably high expectations after seeing the pictures, but as the organizer of a group event you're always kind of nervous that it'll live up to everyone's expectations no matter how good it looks online. I'm happy to report that it exceeded our expectations, and Jon was a great host.

Things that stood out in particular were:
1. It really does sleep 10 comfortably, which is not always the case when you book a large Airbnb.
2. The shared living room/dining room space is large and open, and can host a large group without feeling crowded.
3. The location is excellent. There's more going on in the area than you could  ever hope to fully explore in a long weekend.
4. The parking space(s) in back were a big help because street parking can get tough if there's a Rockies game or event.
5. Jon was super responsive at all hours.
6. Jon was really reasonable about cleanliness and noise. We were pretty responsible, but a big concern I had going into the weekend was that the host would be super nitpicky or difficult. We had no problems whatsoever, which was a big relief for me as the organizer.

I'd definitely bring a group back!","Denver"

I love that they have the coded door handle for check in, and that they make the pin easy to remember. The place was clean and well decorated, I especially liked the shower and bathroom. It was so thoughtful of them to include fresh fruit like bananas, as well as bagels, yogurt, farm fresh eggs, and a bunch more. It saved me on more than one occasion when I felt a little stranded without transportation. It felt spacious an luxurious since I was staying alone. Even though I was only staying for one night, they were incredibly flexible and accommodating when I asked if I could also have a late checkout. Normally I wouldn't do this because I feel like it's taking advantage, but I had some trouble connecting with my boss (this is a work trip, I got the Airbnb to have a couple days to explore beforehand) and he hadn't yet booked a hotel for us or rental car. So I didn't have anywhere to go or even keep my luggage. Tina said I could checkout anytime before 4 which was incredibly generous and something I wouldn't expect if they had another party coming in. You guys don't know how much less stressful you made these past few days! Thanks to you I got to enjoy my first time in Colorado much more and actually have some relaxation! Thank you!! 10/10.","Denver"

Close to light rail
Easy access to enter and leave
Jim, a long term tenant, is helpful and works for Sarah. 
WiFi works well
Bathroom stays fairly clean
Dishes are washed in a timely manner
Refrigerator and cabinets are free for everyone to make use of. 
Sarah has people working for her that help to clean and replace sheets and towels. 

Facts:
No breakfast
Guests were more long term, like tenants
No lock on bedroom
Basement is chilly
Tenants smoke cigarettes and weed, so the house smells like both. Some tenants also tend to be intoxicated often.
Tenants don’t always lock the front door. Back door stays unlocked.
Sarah responded to one message regarding clean sheets and towels but did not respond two days later when I expressed concern about unpredictability of a tenant that made me uncomfortable.
I didn’t feel 100% safe, but tenants proved to be trustworthy for the short time I stayed.
Sarah does not live at the house or visit.","Denver"

The stairs to the upstairs aren't pictured but they are small and steep which was a constant worry with kids under 5. The adults in the house had several close calls on those steps as well! Too hot in that house especially upstairs. Had a hard time sleeping since there is no central AC, just 2 small units. There is a vacant house next door with homeless squatting there which made us feel  a bit uncomfortable. However, George was kind and responsive so if you don't have kids and aren't coming in the summer, it's a central place to stay!","Denver"

I feel lucky to have had the chance to stay at their impeccably designed home... Mindful of all a contemporary travelers needs!! I may be biased but I was just so pleasantly surprised by the details that no photos could do justice. I would recommend to anyone visiting Denver. Also very close inexpensive uber/lyft to RINO Curtis Park Larimer and walking distance to super cute coffee shop. Love this magical gem of a place.","Denver"

The beds are very comfortable and there were extra blankets which we appreciated. We loved the balcony and had breakfast out there every morning. The parking in the back is a huge plus as street parking in this area is challenging. 

The only challenge we faced was that their is only one bathroom (which is clearly advertised and we knew going in), which made getting ready a challenge as it is pretty small. The only other mirror you could get ready in front of is right outside of the bathroom so that area got pretty tight frequently. But it’s a small price to pay for such a stylish apartment with beautiful finishes in an amazing neighborhood and we made it work (even with 4 ladies!)  I will definitely stay again.","Denver"

There was easy access to downtown and most efficient for other areas as well. The interior was very nicely decorated and spacious for our needs.

Off the beaten path, not near anything - need to take transportation to reach anyplace to purchase snacks, get to shopping or entertainment areas.  Ten minute walk to station, which is not great in heat or snow.","Denver"
"6736",21900342,328286004,2018-09-25,111176453,"Anne","Kendall was an excellent host. She’s communicative, makes excellent recommendations and her home was well appointed and very clean. It is a single-family home so there are no shared walls, which was nice. However, during our stay there were a couple of nights where there was incessant dog barking which lasted for 1-2 hours. Luckily Kendall has those wireless speakers you can use to play music on your phone to drown out that noise. The home is on the older side, which wasn’t obvious on the listing, so it does creak and settle throughout the night. If you are a light sleeper this could pose a problem, so you might want to bring ear plugs. And because this is an older home, the water pressure in the bathroom was on the weaker side so if you’re the type of person who likes strong water pressure while showering, etc., this may be a problem.

Kendall’s home was walk-able but during our stay, the weather was mostly in the high 80s side so walking anywhere was a bit uncomfortable. There was a Natural Grocers and Sprouts nearby but it’s about an 8-10-minute walk one-way so if it’s hot, not ideal to be hauling water, etc. in the heat while walking.

Checking in and out was a breeze and for the most part, we enjoyed our stay.","Denver"

They were able to completely accommodate me in bringing my baby by providing a pack n play, sheets, clip on high chair, toys, books, wipes, and even an adorable baby elephant towel just for her. Everything was completely set up and ready to go just as it would be at home. It was very clean and had plenty of linens (including beach towels I asked for last minute). Anything I asked for or requested Sergej was willing to accommodate. The house is in an up and coming neighborhood and was close to everything. It was less than a -0 minute drive to union station, Coors Field, the children’s museum, aquarium, 16th St. Mall, and tons of amazing restaurants. I recommend Next Door in union station and Sunny’s breakfast place (both provide all gluten free options too). 
The beds were very comfortable with a temperpedic like mattress and lots of pillows. There were also lots of staples in the kitchen  such as ketchup, butter, mayo, syrup, salt and pepper, etc. you should definitely check to see what there is before you shop. 
There was a great little yard t play in and sit outside as well. And plenty of parking in the driveway and on the street.

It's perfectly located for out-of-towners, quick access to everything. Walking distance to shops and restaurants and having Katherine’s dog and chickens to greet us nightly was fabulous.

The house is located within walking distance of the Botanic Gardens as well as lots of shops and restaurants. It's not exactly central in Denver, but you can get a Lyft downtown for less than $10. Our favorite place to eat nearby was Tacos Tequila Whisky. It was about a fifteen minutes walk and had great food and drinks. The only problem we had was a battle with some moths that came into the house the first night. Pam started measuring the windows for screens the same day we reported the issue. At the end of the day we got a good story and some entertaining video from that experience. All in all, we had a nice, comfortable time at this Airbnb.","Denver"

When we arrived in Denver, she gave us detailed instructions of how to use public transportation to get to her house. Upon arrival, Pamela was wonderful and inviting and made us feel right at home; even her two dogs are friendly and sweet, and we looked forward to them greeting us at the front door every time we came back. The room was clean and what truly stood out is that Pam thinks of EVERYTHING! From leaving bottled water in the mini fridge to putting an umbrella on the desk in case it rained to things like having a lint roller in the dresser and extra toothbrushes in the bathroom, she simply goes above and beyond to ensure that your stay is as comfortable as possible. She even left a couple extra water bottles outside our door the day before we left, just small little things like that make all the difference. The value staying at this place is unparalleled. I was attending a conference at the convention center during our visit, and this Airbnb was SO CLOSE to the convention center: it would have been an easy walk, but the light rail stops several blocks from her house and it is one stop to the convention center front door. We would stay with Pam again in a heartbeat and are so thankful for her hospitality during our stay!","Denver"

We booked this place as a girl's getaway to celebrate some of our birthdays. Neither of us had ever been to Denver so we didn't know anything about the areas. We ended up choosing this place because it said it slept the most people (8) and because it was close to Colfax. Unfortunately, at the time we booked it there was only one review and only a few pictures of the place, but we decided to go for it anyway. We paid $1050 for 6 nights and it was the biggest rip off of any AirBNB any of us had ever stayed at. Here's a breakdown of everything wrong with this place, in no particular order. Things the host can't control: -It's in an attic of a super old house. -There are 5 flights of really narrow stairs leading up to the unit with 41 stairs total. Making that trek up and down throughout the days was awful, especially with all of our luggage. -There are homeless people and drug addicts/dealers all over this block at all hours of the day, but once night comes it gets even worse. We had to have our Uber drivers wait for us to get inside before they drove off because of how unsafe we felt. Definitely a sketchy and dangerous place not suitable for vacationers. -There is a club across the street that is open all day and has speakers and amplifiers so loud you might as well just go to the club. Spent the week listening to bad karaoke and DJ shoutouts. -The unit had a bad smell, like a mix of old musty mold and weird food. Not pleasant. -The lock to the rental itself is annoying and takes precision and patience to lock. -A lot of noise outside throughout the entire day and night. -Parking is very limited and restricted. Things the host can control: -The shower. Like did they really try to pass this invention off as a legitimate shower? You can't even stand up in it.  It's a triangle shaped hole in a wall with a cotton shower liner that gets immediately soaked. The faucets worked when they wanted to and the shower head barely worked at all. It had like 10 tiny little spurts of water that came out with the most minimal pressure. Not to mention that the water would fluctuate from burning hot to freezing cold every few seconds making it all that much better. This was one of the pictures that was not originally included in the listing and it's obvious why. Seriously I can't believe this was even an acceptable idea. -Exposed electrical wiring in the bathroom. I'm not an electrician but I have a hunch that something like that is really dangerous. -We were provided with less than half a roll of paper towels, 1 1/2 rolls of toilet paper, and 1 garbage...","Denver"

The guests have their own entrance and complete privacy. This is an amazing place and location, one of the best AirBnBs in which I’ve stayed.

If you go out and hit the town or Red Rocks like we did, you can sleep late without noise or light waking you up early. Garrett was a responsive communicator. There were little touches like a bit of coffee in the fridge and sugar. Dishes and a brita pitcher were nice surprises. The bed was a memory foam mattress and with our back problems, this was a life saver! Just like home. A few other things we liked: good water pressure, a Roku, a comfy living room and a safe neighborhood. There is a 7-11 less than a block away and a cute little brunch spot, Barracudas. Try a nightcap at Park Tavern just up the street - they had late night BOGO pints.","Denver"

She texted me on the day to make sure I had an easy entry and had everything I needed.  You can tell she wants her guests to feel at home. 

About the Home: The home is beautiful. It’s HER home so you can see that it is loved and cared for. We especially loved the large open kitchen area as we spent a lot of our time there catching up as we made the meals.  It had all the basics.  The coffee maker could have been larger. It was a small one (which she did specify in her notes.)  However, these are notes as an FYI but should not be a deal breaker.

We absolutely loved the play area which was better than I thought. Kids from 3 to 7 all enjoyed the toys. Also the front yard swing, tree swing and sand box really made the visit feel like staying with a friend as opposed to being in a hotel. It was exactly what we wanted. The location was phenomenal. Not knowing anything about Denver, the location turned out better than expected.  four blocks walking distance to Washington Park and two blocks to Historic South Gaylord with restaurants and shops.

Great find.  Would definitely come back.","Denver"

Access to the garage parking space and the basement apartment being right next to the garage makes this a very convenient set up. If you compare Fred's place to any hotel, the hotels do not even come close to a good comparison. Fred's place is a much nicer place at a much better price than any hotel you will find in the downtown Denver area! 

It was very quiet and easy to get sound sleep over night, and I only heard a few noises of people living upstairs during the day time and it was not excessive at all. It did get a little chilly on my first night in the apartment, but once I fired up the space heaters it warmed up pretty quickly. To give you an idea of how well the space heaters worked, it was about 33 degrees outside and I had both space heaters on in the bedroom, and I woke up in the middle of the night sweating and had to turn one off, so they work very well.

Also, the bed and pillows are VERY comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!","Denver"

Zack was very friendly and was quick to offer his assistance and phone number. He added nice little touches to make our stay feel authentic, like our own home. The home is new and clean. Zack and Bisquit (the house cat) were friendly yet they gave us our space to do our own thing. If you are renting a car it’s a great location as a mid-point between Garden of the Gods and other National Parks.

Even though they didn't have it, they ran out tot the store and purchased brand new toys and humidifiers for us to use. We were more than impressed. Thank you so much for your thoughtfulness and going out of your way to make sure we felt right at home! The place was also immaculate and had everything we needed as well as being super close to restaurants and some nice hikes.","Denver"

Neighborhood is up and coming.  A bit funky, we had no problems, and felt safe. We loved being close to downtown, the interstate, and the light rail.  We didn’t move our car once. 

Super breakfast supplies, eggs, granola bars, oatmeal, bananas, OJ, English muffins, spread for muffins, American Cheese.  Bring your own coffee grounds and creamer.  King Sooper is very close if you need anything 

Only concern was it was a bit stuffy in one of the bedrooms. There are tabletop fans. We could at times hear the people on the wood floors above us. Never late and never early.","Denver"

It’s clear this is side income and the lack of care and attention to this place was upsetting. We spent $700 to live like we were back in our first semester at college. Dozens of Airbnb’s and this was by far the outlier.","Denver"

Ours wasn't great: walking to dinner our first night we routed around a fight with 2x4s going on a block over, which took us past emergency services trying unsuccessfully to resuscitate someone. We took a Lyft back, and the driver told us a) that we should avoid walking around this area, and b) that things were much worse the weekend before. We spent much more of our trip than we intended inside Rob's place instead of exploring. We visited from LA and are used to interacting with homeless folks, but with ~100 people camping out on the sidewalks on the next block this is a different proposition.

The space itself is nice, and pretty well maintained. Our only issue was that the shower curtain was a bit moldy. Otherwise, the bed was comfortable and the kitchen had the things we needed.","Denver"

Building was secure, I didn't feel anxious about the location like some others did. Clean place with necessaries. Best amenity was the washer and dryer I was so happy to take home clean clothes. I would definitely recommend the space to others. 

One con for me was the hardware in the bathroom was basically all broken (2 towel bars and the toilet paper holder) I almost freaked out when the towel bar by the sink fell off the first night when I pulled the hand towel off.  the only other con was the day before we left they asked when we would be leaving and because it was phrased as a question I chose a time that would coincide more closely with our plane leaving, then I received a message that said ""Unfortunately we will need you out by the latest 12:00..."" Questions imply choice, but we were given an additional hour and left at 12 as requested instead of the 11am check out time posted online so I appreciated the extra hour. 

I appreciate that everything was where it was suppose to be and I never had to contact Maribeth or Brian about any issues because I didn't experience any.
Highly recommend.","Denver"

The room was very warm and had no fan. The bed was very old and HARD. The springs made very loud noise when sitting on the bed and/or simply turning over during the night, which was disruptive to a quiet night sleep. We couldn’t open the window due to city noise to help with August heat (and no fan).
To be honest, pretty disappointed in lack of communication from host — normally my Airbnb hosts have been pretty prompt with replies... but Rodney was slow to respond about immediate concerns. He wasn’t solution oriented and was abrupt/short in correspondence. 
Also checkout was listed as 10:30-11; reservation said 10... after brief communication with host, we felt rushed to leave after Rodney said that listing was an error.
Again, location is great — if fan was added and kinder host response, it would be an “A” location.","Denver"

I could write a couple pages on Fish, but I'll make it concise: It has style, value, a full kitchen for guest use, clean bathrooms, and a full bar where everyone meets at night to get to know each other, hang out, play games, and share stories and experiences. I stayed in a shared room - four bunk beds, I believe - and everyone was quiet and courteous of the other guests' space. Everything you'll want to see, downtown at least, is within walking distance; the coolest areas in Denver are no more than a five to 10-minute walk. Obviously this hostel isn't luxury living, but it's pretty luxury in hostel terms, and I'd definitely come back.","Denver"

Our room was located in the very top, considered converted attic space of a beautiful Victorian style home.  The location was ideal because only a couple of blocks away was City Park, and in the opposite direction, we also were able to walk to Cheesman Park, both parks worth strolling through and enjoying! There were also numerous, wonderful local restaurants right around the corner. A Greek bakery down on Colfax we discovered where we sometimes grabbed our coffee and cannolis. This airbnb is close enough to downtown (only few miles by car) , but not too close where we had to endure the noise of traffic and cars. I would give this airbnb 5 stars because of the quality, space, location, and quiet surroundings. We also want to mention that we had cute balcony we used to enjoy our quiet breakfast in the mornings. The area is a beautiful historic neighborhood with many trees. Great airbnb!! We greatly recommend it to someone who wants peace and quiet, and likes to walk and explore the local places in the neighborhood in the heart of Denver.","Denver"

He said it was okay to check in early because he checked with his cleaners, but upon arrival you could definitely tell it was not just cleaned. This is kind of beyond his control, but there was a huge spider on the wall (indicative that someone had not just checked it) and for a 75.00 cleaning fee we felt a little ripped off given there was dust everywhere, crumbs and dirt on the couch etc. Honestly-it was an alight stay but it does not look in person how it does in pictures at all..so expect that. It's a little more run down. The location is alright because its close to downtown and an easy commute but I wouldn't say its the best neighborhood. It does have a sign out front that says ""No gangs"" area. The hot water was easy to fix (it has a safety function) and Jeremiah was quick to respond with an answer for that. Our most concern was that after booking the air bnb, in the itinerary instructions it says that if we run into neighbors to say nothing about air bnb and just say were guests visiting. We don't think its appropriate or professional to ask your guests to lie, perhaps you should pay for the correct licensing to air bnb instead of lying because if the area may be forbidding air bnb-lying is not the way to go about it. He also says please water my plant? Were nice people but for 75.00 have your place cleaned and plants watered-not ask your guest.","Denver"

The space is pretty big for two people, which was nice.  The parking spot was a huge plus, since the surrounding area (and Denver in general) has zero parking opportunities, so the dedicated parking was huge.  I thought the bed and pillows could have been more comfortable.  Also, this is a basement of a house, so there were a few times I could hear conversations and TV on the upper level.

We didn’t spend a lot of time at the townhouse as we were busy sightseeing but he had all the amenities we needed. He was very generous with his supplies and gave us access to a space in the garage. He was always on call and responded quickly if we had any questions or concerns. There weren’t any books or information about the area but we found everything on (Hidden by Airbnb) or asked Mark for recommendations. 
The townhouse was very warm for us, especially at night. Our weather had been quite hot and wish we could have had it a bit cooler. It could’ve used a bit of upgrading in areas and we would’ve liked some outdoor space to enjoy morning coffee or evening drinks. He does have a small patio but it was in a state of disrepair that made it unappealing. He seems to reside there when guests aren’t staying so all of his belongings are scattered around. There is no place to put clothing in the master bedroom, you have to use the guest bedroom closet to hang items. There was no dresser to use either. Luckily it was just my husband and me so we could utilize the guest bedroom to spread clothes out. The townhouse was in a very quiet area just a few minutes from Denver but you should time it so you don’t get caught in the crazy traffic. There are many conveniences close by for groceries, food or shopping. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and thank Mark for his hospitality.

The art filled space is tactfully decorated and serves not only as an amazingly comfortable lodging but also as a live-in art gallery. For my fiancé and I, our stay here will be a lasting part of the memory of relocating to the Denver area. We both worked full time remotely while staying here for 19 days and the place was perfect for our needs. The photographs don't do justice for just how great of a space it is! Oh and they also have tons of very high quality guides for the city and local food, etc. There's also some great places to eat in walking distance!

I can't speak highly enough about just how sincere and generous Marlene and Doug are. It's immediately obvious that you're staying with truly great people. At the same time, they are also incredibly amazing hosts who respect privacy and are as ""hands off"" as you need.

I'm personally not the type of person who ""gets to know"" every single host I stay with - and when I read reviews speaking too much about the host, a small part of me fears the stay will be filled with a bunch of instances of awkward and uncomfortable small talk. That isn't the case here - these are genuinely great people! You'll enjoy your interactions with them and won't feel any of that awkwardness. Stay here. You won't regret it.","Denver"

The house was average with old structure which makes some noise. We tried to be as quiet as possible. The toilet seat was wooden and heavy. As my left arm was immobilized with cast it was very difficult for me to work with one hand. The toilet seat was falling and making loud noise. The host complained about the loud noise which disturbed her sleep. I apologized to her whole heartedly and texted her explaining my disability due to broken arm.

She texted me back without any empathy or understanding, highlighting her sleep disturbance, completly ignoring my situation which I think rude and unwelcoming. 

I meet the host once, most probably on 2nd day. She was pleasant  and friendly  she said that she was an ICU nurse. Both my wife and I are medical doctors.We understand the stress an ICU nurse has to go through. Stress and lack of sleep is part of the job. But empathy,compssion, understanding is the essense of health care profession.

Any way....this was my over all experience!","Denver"

It was so nice to be able to walk to City Park, and downtown was just a quick drive/Uber away. The kitchen has everything you need if you decide to eat in, and there is a grill outside as well. Another nice touch was the little basket of hotel-sized toiletries in the bathroom in case you forget something like we did.

Something to note if you're staying with young children (we have three under 5) - one bedroom is upstairs and two are in the basement (one of these has a deluxe air mattress as a bed). Being in a new place, the kids weren't comfortable being a floor away from us. We easily remedied this by taking the basement bedroom and giving them the air mattress room, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

It easily accommodated my wife and I and had several separate areas to allow us to have our own private space, if we chose to. The outdoor areas were wonderful for morning coffee, playing cards, reading and just relaxing in general. The location puts you just a couple blocks away from several options for food and drinks. Taking a little further walk opens you up to many more options. Union Station is about a 20 minute walk (up hill both ways, LOL) where you can hop on a light rail or bus that will take you to pretty much any part of the city, including the airport. We would definitely stay here again.","Denver"

We had lots of space, a great table for the four of us to sit and eat our meal, and comfy couch and carpet area to enjoy our movie night together! We also appreciated the big bathroom with bathtub for the kids.  They were kind to mention in their description the unfinished bedroom, but it was even cuter than a typical finished bedroom, in our opinion. We absolutely loved it.  It had a very comfortable bed, a big dresser, hangers, and lots of places to set our stuff.  This is definitely where we will stay next time!","Denver"

"7218",15311394,229817181,2018-01-25,168622806,"Phil","To be clear, this was my first Airbnb, but it was not my idea of a bed and breakfast, with or without breakfast. If I had to describe my experience in one word it would be ""odd"". The entry of the house was dark and I felt uncomfortable letting myself in without someone to greet me. The lay out was my room is on the second floor along with another rental and one common room. If I had not seen the picture of my room I would have been nervous I was in the right space. After I dropped my bags and was going out for the evening I noticed there is no lock on the door, which was worrisome since it was obvious there would be other renters. After reading the house rules I found there is a ""landlord"" living on the first floor and Elise lives on the third floor, but at no time during my stay did I actually talk with anyone. The room was reasonably pleasant but the shades were torn and stained, there were seven, count 'em seven empty or half empty shampoo bottles in the shower, the tile was missing grout and had paint splatters, the vanity was beat. I am not opposed to funky but this was something else. And the kicker was even in daylight the next day, I couldn't find the light switch in the bathroom. I could have texted Elise but it was late when I got in that night, so  just dealt with it. I suppose you get what you pay for, but overall I was disappointed.","Denver"

"7278",20914531,231985692,2018-02-03,92363828,"Lara","Glen and Camille’s place was spotless and check in was a breeze. My husband and I visited Denver with our 3-year-old for a 2-night stay and their space was a good home base. I’m a transit geek so we did not rent a car while we were in town and were able to get around pretty well without one. There is pretty good connectivity b/w the light rail and bus systems - so we were able to visit various locations downtown, the REI store, and the children’s museum all “on foot” (and toting a stroller).  The immediate neighborhood was pretty quiet, as was the neighbor on the other side of the townhome wall. This was perfect for our needs, but wouldn’t be the best option for a group who wanted to gab all night. But there are fun restaurants, breweries, etc. a short walk away. 

In terms of amenities: I was very impressed by the thoughtful touches - coffee and tea available in the kitchen and a variety of shampoo/conditioner/bath wash in the bathroom. There is no TV in the unit, but constant and strong WiFi to serve all your media needs. And we found the futon to be quite comfortable with the addition of the (provided) mattress pad. 

For interested parents: This unit worked well for our son, but if you have “runner” please note that there are steep (for a 3yo) steps out front (there’s a chain on the front door) as well as in the bedroom (the stairs lead off on the way to the door to the back patio). There’s no chain on the back door, but there is a slide lock that managed to evaded my kid’s initial attempt and he never tried it again..","Denver"

There were many great restaurants, grocery and a park walking distance and it was very close to the airport. We had 5 guests flying from different locations and met at this house to get some great work done. Since the restaurants and grocery were at a walking distance, we did not waste any time for food. The living room spaces provided us great places to get in small and big groups to have our discussions done. The neighborhood was very quiet as well. The house was very clean and had all our needed items (kitchen for basic cooking, tv for projecting work for group discussions, spacious bedrooms, etc.). The internet connection was spotty time to time but we think it was due to having several computers and phones trying to connect. Jordan was great to provide answers quickly.

The apartment is clean and comfortable, and the hot tub is a lovely amenity for an unexpected snow shower. Kevin was very responsive and he made great recommendations for seeing the sights. When I pinged him *on the day of check-in* to ask if we could get in early (eyeroll), he still managed to clean up and let us in a little early. 10/10, would recommend!

Brought the kids to stay here for a weekend, and we were close to the zoo and aquarium, but not in a location where I would be comfortable letting them run around in the yard. The house could use a professional cleaning from top to bottom as well. All in all, if you want “value,” you’ll get your “dollar’s worth” in staying here.","Denver"

We had an issue with the Wifi (a bill was not paid) so we didn't have access for at least half the trip (we were there 3 nights). There were some communication issues along the way (she didn't respond for about 24 hours [we left a couple texts, a phone call, and a voicemail]), it did put quite a damper on the trip. Finally after getting ahold of her, we were notified it'd be up very shortly. We went all the way back to the apartment only to then find out it'd be a few more hours. I would hope this would be a rare occurrence with her properties, but had I known the Wifi wouldn't be available I would've stayed somewhere else. I wish Wifi wasn't such a necessity, but anymore we rely on it. Airbnb helped make up for it, but still just overall disappointed in the experience.","Denver"

Everything was neat and clean and orderly, bed was super comfy, with clean, comfortable linens.

Specifically, we received our check in instructions much later than expected.  I thought we were to receive them around 11 am. We got them at 2:30 pm, after we'd left our homes and headed to the condo. 

The key fob didn't work when we arrived and no one responded to our calls or texts for help. Jim, the Concierge, finally offered to assist us. 

We couldn't control the temperature in the room with the thermostat and there were no instructions on how to adjust it. We had to leave the deck door open most of the night to cool off the room. 

None of these would've been major issues had someone been available to respond to our requests for assistance. It was very frustrating as we had a short window of time between our arrival and our dinner reservation.","Denver"

I want to say that my experience at Trace's place appears to be an anomaly compared to what others have experienced in past reviews. Trace's place was very clean, but there were moths (I counted at least 15) flying around the entire apartment. After I killed all the moths in the bedroom and sequestered myself in there with the door shut, I still felt a bit uncomfortable getting a good night's sleep (I'm not a fan of bugs, especially those that fly at me). If the moths weren't an issue, it would have been a 5 star stay. Hopefully this temporary moth issue will be quickly taken care of and people can continue to enjoy 5 star stays at Trace's place.","Denver"

Favorites:
1) New remodel and extremely clean!
2) Location
3) Privacy

To consider:
1)  Parking
2) Family lives upstairs

I stay in Airbnb's often and this was one of my favorites.  Angie (the host) incorporates many thoughtful touches which made my stay more comfortable.  Some of my favorites were the noise machine, extra space fan and heater and high quality bed and bedding.  While the host family lives upstairs, I barely heard them at all and probably could have done without the noise machine, but appreciated that it was there as an option.  

In addition, I loved the location!  Sloan lake area is a nice and safe neighborhood in close proximity to breweries and restaurants.  I had a rental car and found parking to be a minimal concern.  Street parking is available, but keep in mind that it does fill up a night.

The home is a very short drive (approx. 15mins) from Downtown and near many hiking trails and parks.

Overall, I highly recommend this airbnb and host!","Denver"

The masterbed is so hard that my husband and I fought over sleeping on the couch. Her basement apt does not have a door at the bottom of the stairs, so when she was leaving out of the back door she could see downstairs. I felt like all privacy was lost. She has extremely spotty wifi, and it would frequently go out during the night, where we would have to restart the firestick and the wifi on our cellphones. She has a beautiful back yard, and her house is centrally located to Denver and Aurora, about 15-20 mins. She also has a cute dog named Maggie, who would come downstairs and visit.

The place is modern, comfy, private and stylish. Amy and Adam have added so many thoughtful little touches that make the place that much more sweet. Helpful little items like creamer in the fridge for coffee, a razor and toothpaste in the bathroom in case you forgot yours, twister in the closet, cool Colorado decor, and even a couple of Denver postcards and stamps! 

We live in Denver and periodically have too much company for our small place. This will be my go-to for visiting family!","Denver"

However, they wouldn't open for us, so we went through the main doors into the lobby.  The woman at the desk had to let us in, since we didn't have the fob to the building.  She asked us where we were staying and told us immediately that the airbnb here is illegal and they aren't allowed to rent out the space.  We were so afraid that we would be kicked out and have nowhere to stay.  Luckily, she let us still stay for the night.  The place was nice, however, the TV didn't work.  There was no cable and the Amazon stick attached to it didn't have the correct chords to plug it in.  So basically the large TV just sitting there was useless, and definitely was a damper on our stay there.  I tried reaching out the Chris about this issue, with no response.  Would never stay here again, and hope this listing will not be up anymore so that other people won't have to go through this.","Denver"

The hosts were super communicative once our trip began about check-in, parking, etc. There was coffee and a couple of snacks, too, which was a nice touch. We ended up being able to walk to several cafes, breweries, etc. The only things I would say made the apartment less pleasant than home were the fact that there's no door on the bedroom, so in the morning the light from the front window is extremely bright, and the apartment is on a bottom floor of an old single-family home, so late at night and early in the morning the upstairs residents had boisterous conversation and we could hear them walking around.

My son and daughter and myself enjoyed coming home each evening to a comfortable house with all the amenities after a day of visiting DU, hiking Red Rocks (the gorgeous sunrise is well worth the climb and early hour), and shopping. We did not rent a car but found that Lyft was available to take us anywhere at a moments notice. Very affordable and stress-free!

As a host Anthony was wonderful. He was quick to communicate, helpful, friendly, and willing to go above and beyond. On our final day of stay he offered to bring our luggage to us when he picked us up from the zoo on our way to the airport. His other business offers driving services—an extra bonus you won’t get from many other hosts!

We were somewhat disappointed in the location.  Home is not on Sloan’s Lake but rather a few blocks away.  It is across from an auto parts store and there is no view from the rooftop deck.  The neighborhood seemed safe just not quite what we expected.  I should have asked a few more questions.

She's quite knowledgeable and basically convinced me to move to Denver (I'll be back!) Coffee and towel were nice touches. Just an FYI - there is no microwave. Diego the cat is adorable & sassy (hide the plant in your room from him in your closet or else he'll chew on it!) I stayed 6 nights and Sarah was only there for 2 of the days so I felt like I had the place to myself. The bathroom has an awesome sunlight window on the roof. Go to the waffle house for breakfast & check out South Broadway for hipster-y shops & dope ice cream at Sweet Action or punk stuff at Mutiny Cafe. Mercury Cafe (a 10 min. drive) is pretty cool, too.","Denver"

Upstairs neighbors were horrendously loud until about 3:30 am, the apartment smelled like someone had not been taught to use a restroom properly, and the sheets were dirty. Nice location if you like the business of downtown life but was not what we had in mind for our little family of 3.","Denver"

It was so charming and cozy- exactly what I like in an Airbnb. Everything was clean and tidy, and there was even a W/D which eliminated the next day’s task of finding a laundromat.

The location is awesome, easy to get to via public transit, and lots to do nearby. I will definitely stay here again when I return to Denver.","Denver"

The space itself was exactly as described and pictured. It's a spacious basement unit of a house in a quiet neighborhood, and has (I think) a great eclectic style. This was one of the cleanest AirBnB properties I've ever stayed in, which made it even more pleasant and comfortable. Even things that are sometimes hit-or-miss like climate, water pressure, etc. were great.

The neighborhood is residential and quiet, but only requires about a 15min car ride to get to the downtown area. There are several good coffee shops and places to eat within just over a mile.

When it's all said and done, I had a fantastic stay and would recommend Beth and her unit to anyone!","Denver"

It has a nice spacious living room, a bar counter. Niki and Barb also keep the place spotless clean! The bed and pillows are so comfy that I decided that I am getting the same pillows when we are back home. The place also is fully loaded that we can find everything we need. And of course, we loved the fact that it's dog friendly, and our little guy got a backyard to wonder in, and I can tell he was pretty happy.

The place is conveniently located close to a very nice neighborhood that has quite few big parks close by, city park and Cheeseman Park. There are some very lovely restaurants close by as well. We loved ""olive and finch"", a brunch & coffee shop and we hang out there every day when we were there.

Great appliances and showers, and super comfy beds.  Some minor issues are: only a single parking space within the building, no toilet paper, and one bathroom has a curtain instead of a door making privacy awkward.

He gave us many useful local tips, had tea and coffee  ready on hand for us at breakfast, and overall made us feel right at home.  The only thing I will add here is that the room is small, and as advertised, the house has no ac (even though it stays remarkably cool given then 94 degree-ish temperatures outside), so keep that in mind as you consider the place, if these things are important to you.

This is a perfect place if you are in your 20's and don't mind walking a mile or so to some nice spots. There is a lot of homeless people in the area but that just might be Denver.  For around $150 it is a great value and if I was by myself and not with my wife, I'd happily stay here again. Without a doubt you will here the people upstairs walking and the water running from the pipes. Don't expect hotel style cleanliness as this is an older place. There are a few bug issues that need to be taken care of. They do have some plug in pest deterrents, so they are trying to handle the pest issue. There were 2 flies that traveled at Mach-1 speed and 2 spiders that made me a bit uneasy. The place was also a bit hot and not until the middle of the night did it cool down, common complaint according to other reviews.","Denver"

We were not disappointed. Even though we had a car to use, we rarely drove it (keeping it off the street and in Josh's garage was a bonus), instead walking and taking full advantage of the close proximity of a supermarket, wine stores, parks, coffee shops and restaurants. Downtown Denver, with all it has to offer, was within walking distance too and after several long days out, Uber was readily available and inexpensive. On the day of check-in, we arrived to town early and Joshua went out of his way to have his place cleaned and ready for us to move in before 4 pm. While there, he respected our privacy and communication was kept strictly through the airbnb app. Our few concerns and/or questions were addressed in a timely fashion. We enjoyed our stay at Joshua's place and would not hesitate to recommend it, especially for families or friend groups.","Denver"

If you ever wanted to create a book on how to be the best hosts I would certainly spend a lot of time studying Annabelle and Christians best practices. Then again you can't always teach how to truly care for others.  Beyond the hosts being awesome ..

There was no problem with me using the kitchen and its appliances such as fridge and microwave. I also appreciated being able to do a load of laundry while I was there. My room and attached bath were very private. and well appointed.  The location was ideal. My first couple of days I had no car but this was not a problem because the house is located close (approximately a 10 minute walk) to a light rail station that connects directly to Union Station and the free 16th St shuttle to downtown. Later in the week I rented a car to travel out of town for sightseeing. Since the house is located close to a major highway, getting out of the city in the morning and back in the evening was a breeze. And because there was ample street parking in front of their house returning home after a full day on the road was hassle-free. I hope to return to Denver in the future and will definitely plan to stay here again.","Denver"

As a light sleeper, I wish I would have realized that an old mansion such as this one would have little to no insulation - we were kept up by our neighbors until 1am 3 of the 4 nights - I wouldn't say they were unreasonably loud, it's just that the walls are remarkably thin and you can hear EVERYTHING.

Some tips I would give to others staying. the comforter can be a little heavy but you can always remove it. It is uberable from downtown and most of denver within a couple minutes of a pool, highly reccomend going this route vs public transport. Also while it initially did seem a little hot in the room, the fans made it almost too cold into the night.

The inside is really nice. Comfy, artsy, and a haven for travelers. Thank you!","Denver"

They put a lot of thought and effort into being hosts, and planned every amenity available down to the last detail.  Scott and Amina were super responsive and made sure we knew that they were available if we needed anything in addition to proactively checking on us to make sure that we made it in okay but managed the delicate balancing act of being very respectful of privacy at the same time.

10/10 would recommend.  I'm definitely going back!","Denver"

That being said, it’s not a noisy or overly busy section of town. The area is surrounded by quaint, quiet streets that are perfect for walking. Plus, it only took about 5 min to get into downtown Denver. The space itself is on the smaller side but is totally fine for two people. The bathroom is a bit small, due to the layout of the house but that is really the only thing to note. Everything else was perfect!","Denver"

We enjoyed the small deck off the master bedroom.  The kitchen was supplied well, the furniture comfortable for evenings of conversation and hockey watching!  Plenty of hot water for 4 adults as well.
The walk to downtown Denver was not bad, once reaching the 16th St Mall, the free trolley cut out some walking so we could enjoy a stroll around the capitol and city hall area, visiting the art museum as well.   We felt safe, a few folks asked for money but never felt threatened by them.
We enjoyed dinner at Russell's Smokehouse downtown-loved the shrimp and grits!  In the RiNo district, the Denver Central Market with their variety of food choices was wonderful!  The Snooze café was enjoyable (we went later morning and no line!) with excellent variations of eggs benedict.  We also took advantage of the easy walk to Crema for morning coffee and quiche.
This apt is well located, close access to the freeways and central to our destinations of Fort Collins, Severance (Bruces hasn't changed much since our last visit in 1986 and the ""oysters"" still as delicious-favorite=buffalo!) and Colorado Springs for a revisit of Garden of the Gods and Manitou Springs.  We also loved seeing Red Rocks again after 34 years-last visit James Taylor in 1984!  A beautiful display of God's natural Hand creating an amphitheater!
Julie is a wonderful hostess, there when needed but not at all intrusive.   She even had a balloon bouquet tied to the stair rail for our friends 40th anniversary!  We would definitely recommend her home apartment for your stay in Denver!!","Denver"

Two things to be aware of....there are two FULL flights of stairs so if you are staying for an extended period and have a lot of stuff like I did, this was challenging.

The second thing is that there is only a regular lock on the bedroom door. As a woman traveling alone, I would have preferred a keypad or even key entry.

Thanks Ethan. For hosting me!","Denver"

I didn’t know the Denver area when booking my stay, so in retrospect, I would have liked to have stayed in LoHi area. This Airbnb is in a decent location proximity-wise, however my guest and I found that we weren’t comfortable walking places after dark because of the people we kept running into a few blocks away who would holler things at us or approach us. Alexandra was out of town but her house sitter Ron was helpful. It was very kind to offer breakfast food! As other reviews state, the pictures are a little dated and the house was very “lived in” with used tooth brushes, old soap bars, etc in our bathroom. The bed was very comfortable! Overall, if you are a young adult who will be in and out of the house a lot, and who likes to walk around and explore, I would recommend a different area and a private house to stay in.","Denver"

We had tons of privacy when we wanted, and were greeted every morning with coffee and breakfast if we wanted. The space is actually a whole building that has been converted to a home. We basically had the whole entire upstairs to ourselves with the most comfortable bed, private bath that included a gorgeous claw foot tub/shower, living room space, and washer and drawer. If you’ve ever been hesitant to stay in a private room vs. an entire place to yourself, don’t be when booking Gene’s place!

You can’t beat the location! We were able to walk to restaurants, bars, and shopping all in a very safe area. My husband and I loved our stay so much that we can’t to go back to Denver and stay with Gene again! Bonus- his son is a very talented artist and his work is displayed all over the place.

This was my first ever time using AirBnB, and if I am honest, I think it will be tough to beat. Linda's place is absolutely beautiful. The apartment is part of a mansion house complex and is spacious, comfortable and decorated wonderfully.  The guest bedroom and bathroom are very nice and the bed was super comfy. 

Location wise it is 5 mins walk from the Capital building and about a 30 min walk to the city centre (or 10min bus), but I found walking was absolutely fine. The house is on a nice safe street. 

Although Linda was away during my stay, she made arrangements for me to get in and communicated quickly and clearly with me throughout my stay. If Should I return to Denver one day,  I would certainly want to stay here again!

Thank you so much Linda!

She didn't mind us checking in a little early and her place is very centrally located to some interesting places.

My wife and I could tell right away that Bill and Rita cared immensely about their guest's experience.  The communication was quick.  The house was immaculate.  They had many touches through the experience that really shined.  For instance, they programmed a special code for our family before we got there, so we could enter the house and garage with ease.  They had ""hotel style"" shampoos and soaps.  Each bathroom had a hairdryer. Linens were fresh and clean.  Plus, we could tell they did their research on simple yet often overlooked items, like pillows.  The pillows were plentiful and nice quality, the kind you would expect at a luxury hotel.  There were cards and games to play. Beautiful private back area, that actually looks like the pictures!  And they gave a little history of the house and the area which made us feel connected to the home and neighborhood. 

My wife, 2 daughters and I would, without hesitation, stay again!","Denver"

The space itself is well thought out and tastefully renovated, comfortably accommodating four guests.  What really sets Kathryn's place apart is her attention to detail.

The host is highly unresponsive. I learnt this from my communication. 

Coming on to some cons - The bedroom had light coming in from the street at night which might disturb people. The kitchen utensils had food stuck on them. I had to do one round of dish washing before using most of them. The bathroom liquid soap was stinky so I bought a new one. 

I had a twelve day stay. Overall it was okay but could have been better if the host was little accommodating to the requests and had a round of inspection across the apartment before letting people in.","Denver"

Literally a 5 minute walk to the capital building and plenty of restaurants, bars, grocery store, a liquor store and a 7/11, pretty much everything you’d need.

We loved the location, very central to all things Denver, and liked that we could walk to Sloan's lake, Starbucks, a movie theatre, and a brewpub.  It's listed as a two bedroom, but there is a den off of the living room with a sofabed in it and double doors with drapes that really turns it into a three bedroom.  There is even plenty of free street parking.

I wouldn't hesitate at all to stay there again.

I spent most of my days hiking in the Rockies, but Valerie and Ben's place served as a convenient homebase for some morning/evening smoke sessions before heading out for breakfast or dinner in Denver. They were usually around, but I always felt like I had as much privacy as I needed. I would typically see them in the evenings during which we'd share some stories and they would offer tips for places to check out, which was always appreciated! I noticed that both the private bathroom and bedroom were very clean and had all you might need, including things like shampoo, soap, lotion, sunscreen, and extra umbrellas, which I know I have found myself needing while traveling. 

Overall, I loved my trip to Denver/the Rockies and would definitely stay with Valerie and Ben again if I travel through the area in the future!

This loft is stylish and fun with tons of great decor details. It was spotlessly clean with all the amenities you could need and probably more than you could have expected. It was private and cozy with a sweet little patio space.  The welcome book and city guide was so detailed and helpful with tons of maps they printed up and located all the best spots around the neighborhood. The beds were comfy with super soft bedding and plush pillows. The bedrooms are a little small, so you have to do some maneuvering to get around the bed and into the closet, but honestly, it hardly mattered.

It kept us very warm when it was snowing out, we were able to enjoy a nice movie on the Roku after a day of exploring, and there was even a kitchen if we wanted to cook our own meals. The location was amazing as well because you are in walking distance of so many great things to do (Denver Zoo, Museums, Downtown, Restaurants/Shops). 10/10 recommend coming here and I would definitely come back if in Denver again!","Denver"

First off, I arrived around 8:30 PM and it was a very very sketchy area, entrance, and house (pretty creepy actually). The yard was a mess and so was the house. When I arrived, the room door code did not work and I called and texted John but he did not answer any of my messages. I then had to knock upstairs on apparently a tenants door and she looked very confused and they came downstairs and let me in. The whole house was very eerie. I wake up to in POUNDING KNOCK on the door at 8am from John telling me that it's 8am and I have to get out.  I have never been to a place where 8 am was the checkout and where someone was so rude about it. And threatened to charge me $50. He confronted me (literally a verbal argument outside) and said you're the only person that couldn't get into the room. I rechecked the code and it still didn't work. I felt very uncomfortable just in the house and as I was leaving it just seemed like a horror movie outside house. I don't want make any assumptions of who wrote the other reviews, but in other post it says it's a safe location, I promise you that's not what it felt like. John was extremely rude the house was a total mess and I would not recommend this place anyone. I felt scared. Airbnb should consider removing this host from their platform.","Denver"

"8560",13839510,230021941,2018-01-26,7531884,"Sarah","This is definitely a cool space, with unique design features. It was my first time with the keyless entry for an airbnb, and it took me awhile to get used to the security system saying, ""door open,"" but I do think it gives both a feeling of security and freedom to come and go as you please. 

The pros: a beautiful space. The stones on the shower floor, the glass sink, and the paint colors all create a lovely aesthetic. The bed is extremely comfortable and supportive. There were extra towels provided, and there was water in the fridge, which was a nice touch. It's a short trip to downtown -- I wound up taking the Lyft line twice, and both times cost me only $4.

The cons: for anyone with fragrance sensitivities or allergies, this may not be an ideal spot. There are a lot of strong scents - from plug-ins to fragrance sticks/diffusers. Additionally, this is a renovated garage/basement space, and so it makes sense that there are some insects -- I was joined by some ants in the bathroom, some cobwebs, and a pretty large spider in the bedroom. Such is life on a ground floor level though. 

Overall, I do think the hosts have put careful thought into designing this space.","Denver"

There was trash under our bed upon arrival. The locks on the doors are messed up and it takes multiple tries to get the door unlocked. The water wouldn't get hot,  the stairs are so noisy the whole house wakes up every time they're used. There was a big crack in the ceiling above our bed. It was honestly a miserable time and we tried to find other accommodations while we were there. It felt like a circus with how many people were stuffed into the house at one time, and I was extremely confused by the wording of her listing. We had 4 adults and none of us realized how packed this place would be from the listing when we read it. And I have no idea how 4 adults and 1 child would comfortably fit into our room on one full size bed and a bunk bed. We would have had a better time at a hotel and we were disappointed that we weren't in fact in a hotel. At least at a hotel my 6 year old wouldn't almost pee her pants in the mornings waiting for the bathroom to open up. It was a terrible experience at best overall","Denver"

The yard is lovely-- a fire pit! I mean, come on! Maaaaaybe I'm an idiot, but the firepit is filled with what looks like super savage broken glass, but is honestly just totally harmless glass shards that aren't sharp at all... you know, standard firepit filling? What I'm saying is DON'T PANIC YOUR FEET ARE FINE ENJOY YO'SELF!

OH AND! Can we just take a minute to talk about the bathroom in the basement bedroom with the clawfoot tub *AND* a shower with dual heads? Holy cow, talk about decadence. If I hadn't planned so dang much, I would have spent the whole weekend in a bubble bath.

Anydangway, 10/10 would absolutely stay again.","Denver"

The location is great and close to all the festivities and area restaurants and shopping. The home is older which was not a problem for us. The issue we had was with the cleanliness. The home needs a deep cleaning. The bathrooms and kitchen were not clean. The oven was so greasy the entire house filled with smoke and it was unuseable. The pans were warped it was almost impossible to cook in them.
The pillows and mattresses were all stained. I have stayed in many AirBnB’s and never been as disappointed as I was this time. I do need to add though, Mary did refund our cleaning fee when I informed her of the condition of the home. This could be a lovely rental with some attention. At $1,800 a week (including fees) we expected more.","Denver"

Conveniently located within 5 miles or less to LoHi, RiNo, Speer, Progress Park, LoDo, and more, this spot gets you your own bedroom and bathroom. Your hosts, Terri and Forrest (her French bulldog), are very sweet and welcoming, and will make you feel right at home. Your room will have snacks and coffee, as well as miscellaneous toiletries to purchase for a small price. She’ll also put a small chocolate in your room for each day that you’re there. Small things like that plus just an amazing place make for a great stay - probably one of the best I’ve ever had. If you’re without a car, this place gets plenty of Lyft and Uber drivers so you won’t be without a ride for long. There are restaurants and bars literally seconds from this place, so you cannot go wrong here. Do yourself a favor and book here!","Denver"

Down the street was a pizza joint, across the street is a great coffee spot to bring you back to life in the AM, and right around the corner is a great local pub to make the morning coffee shop a necessity. 

Just a few blocks away, in easy walking distance is a great brewpub with fantastic food. The perfect spot to spend the first evening after a long day of traveling.

Tip: 
Check out the happy hour and specials at The Lobby restaurant - good food and prices. When you eat there, tell them you are staying at an airbnb in the building and you'll get a 15% discount. Then - if you are in to it - take your Lobby receipt down the street to the MMJ America dispensary for a 20% discount. Then take your receipt from the dispensary back to the Lobby the next time you eat there for a 20% discount. Repeat as needed. 

Couple things to note:
*Not much privacy - no door to the bedroom, and only one bathroom next to the main loft-style bedroom, with the sink in the open area. Didn't bother us. 
*Stairs - its a couple flights up to the unit, then you go up or down a level within the unit too. I don't mind the exercise.","Denver"

The owners typically live here, so you will see their stuff, pictures, etc. throughout the house, but there's still plenty of room for your own gear.  Note that the patio is pretty small, and not private at all, with the adjacent townhouse units having their own connecting patios, but this was the only slight negative we found.  Very nice to have a dedicated parking space in the back.  And there are good restaurants & bars within a 10-minute walk, or an infinite amount of cool spots to check out within a 5-to-10 minute drive.  Finally, the owners were super-nice to work with, and we had a totally smooth & pleasant stay at their casa!","Denver"

Only about a $15-20 Uber/Lyft ride to downtown Denver.  

The apartment was completely spotless.  The kitchenette is very functional - enough to cook full meals if desired!  Although the bathroom is small, I didn't have any issues with it.  There is a very large walk-in closet for hair/make-up etc.

The rooftop is nice and would be a good place to hang out on a nice day.  Just some advisories: 1) There are a number of steps to climb (from the front door up to the living room up to the bedroom and up to the roof, if you go there).  We didn't mind the steps but if you are someone who does, it may be a consideration point.  2) The garage is small.  It's big enough for a mid-size car or smaller but anything bigger than mid-size does not fit.  

Location: The location is great - situated just Northwest of downtown Denver, which makes it easy to get around.  The neighborhood has a coffee shop, wine shop, pub, salon, and restaurant within a convenient walking distance.  There is a supermarket a few blocks away which also is convenient.  

Inquiry Response: Pretty quick, usually within an hour or two.

Overall it was a great stay and we would stay again.","Denver"

Elise and Sam were very gracious when I woke them up early Saturday morning because I'd locked myself out of my room. I would definitely stay here again.

There's great water pressure in the bathroom and the shower gets really hot! The bed is a very soft memory foam. The best part of my stay for me was the diligent communications about access and check-ins from Leah and Sarah. Everything was very straightforward. No weird surprises!

Obviously close to many great restaurants but this newly gentrified neighborhood is still painstakingly working out the kinks. It’s very loud.  I thought after a couple weeks I’d get used to it but the interstate noise was always present and opening the windows for fresh air wasn’t in the cards.  The air conditioning was great for air movement as an alternative but not the same.  Neighbors were mostly quiet except for the barking dogs next door who liked to terrorize our toddler every time we walked down the driveway.  On our final night my work truck was spray painted, luckily not terrible, but enough to spend a couple hours having to deal with it.","Denver"

Across the street is a community center and I assume they were preparing for a dance performance. Loud music was played between 7pm - 10pm each day. Not going to lie, this was pretty annoying, but I assume this is not an everyday normal occurrence, though it was for me.

The apartment is less than a 10min walk to a great strip of restaurants and bars. Short lyft to downtown or a nice walk if the weather is nice. 

A beautiful community park across the street. Really wish I had more time in the mornings to go for walks and take in the neighborhood more.

All in all, an enjoyable experience. I saw a couple of bugs because there's some minor exposure between windows, but hard not to expect to see a bug or two after a day of summer rain.","Denver"

A bit of a walk to the main downtown, but we rented a car and loved the off-street parking right behind the house. The space is clean and equipped with all the things you need (comfortable bed, linens, kitchen supplies). Communication was quick and accurate. A great value - especially if you appreciate a full-size fridge, sink, and living room.
The bedroom space is small - more like a ""bed area"" - and if you're really tall you'll need to duck a bit to use the shower  (my partner is 6' 2"" and he had to bend to get in there) - but we found the perks of our stay made this a terrific option for us.

It was so much nicer, quieter, cleaner, and safer than being in the main city. Mind you, we're from Long Beach and can roll with the punches but the neighborhood of Baker has so much more in the food arena and activity-wise that we enjoyed spending time in Baker vs. anywhere else in Denver. The home is beautifully styled, more amenities than any hotel, and is super comfortable with awesome hosts.

Plenty of attractions within walking distance as well. It took us 15 minutes to walk to the Denver Museum of Art.

Kate’s place was exactly what we were looking for!  Not only was it conveniently located for us, only being a few blocks away, but my family really enjoyed staying in Kate’s comfortable basement unit.  The unit itself is surprisingly spacious, with a good-sized and fairly well-stocked kitchen, eating area, living room, bedroom and two bathrooms.  The master bedroom and bath are both updated and tasteful.  I heard great things about the shower in the master bath! The bed was comfortable, allowing for a good night’s sleep.  Chris is the property manager and was great with the communication.  He provided us with all the information we needed well in advance and even contacted me by phone on the first day of the stay to make sure everything was okay.  Finally, the location is great.  As a full-time resident, I may be biased, but I love the Platt Park neighborhood, and Kate’s place is in a great spot – tucked between Broadway with all of its quirky shops and restaurants and the charm of Old South Pearl Street.  We were very satisfied with our stay here – thanks Kate and Chris!","Denver"

The location was very walkable and close to restaurants, yoga, coffee shops (shout out to Rosebuds) green space and public transit. It was charming, clean and just the right size for the two of us - nice open seating area. I found it surprisingly quiet and just what we needed. It was warm enough in March that I was able to sit on the balcony and from my perch I could enjoy the backyard garden and fountain below. The outdoor space was quaint and I can imagine it is lovely in the spring and summer. Our hosts were very gracious. We will definitely return.","Denver"

All of us loved it, everyone was really comfortable.  Checking in was super easy, the space was clean and pleasant, my dad and stepmom especially commented on the quirky decor that they really liked.  The rooftop area was perfect for lunch and for lounging with a bottle of wine.  The deli next door - literally next door - makes awesome sandwiches; if you stay here I highly recommend you get at least one meal there.  We also had excellent pizza delivered from Marquis, I highly recommend them as well.  The neighborhood in general seemed like it's in transition, but overall felt safe.

Initial instructions were a bit complex but all communications with Sophia were great, with instant responses. Once I was in and settled, everything was easy and I look forward to returning, hoping to make this my Denver home for 8+ nights each baseball season. 
After two multi-night stays at another nearby Airbnb rental with exposed outdoor parking, I especially appreciated the secure underground parking at Sophia's place. A note: to exit the parking garage, you have to go back the way you came in: Ignore all the arrows and Exit signs as they lead deeper and deeper, then dead end. Exit is easy: go back the way you came in, and no fob (clicker) is needed to open gate outbound.

"8963",11482047,315807536,2018-08-29,152411578,"Matthew","I'll just echo some of what the other users said about this place. First off, it's about 2 miles from downtown. Unless you are renting a car, I would recommend staying closer to downtown. Secondly, there are homeless people hanging out in the alley out back, and while I don't care much about that and nor were they loud or bothersome, it's something to note. 

As for the important things. The AC unit downstairs doesn't work, and the AC upstairs is totally inadequate. It's not a big space, so a couple of window units should be sufficient. The hosts were a little too unresponsive for me, as the couple of questions I had took basically a day for a response. Considering that it is two people with multiple properties, I would expect some quicker communication. 

Small things. There is an iron and an ironing board (which at least is provided unlike other places), and while the iron is crappy as expected, the ironing board is some weird table-top board, which is not ideal for a place that has only countertops. Doing dishes was a little annoying as I did not see any brushes, so it was just a lot of soap and paper towels.

All-in-all, the stay was fine for me, but it was just the little things that added up to make me recommend this place only if you are aware of what you are getting into. I will say the value was excellent, however, but to me there was just a certain lack of care that would not be exhibited if the hosts actually lived at the property. Then when you tack on the location not being as good of a spot as many would hope for, it might be best to look elsewhere.","Denver"

It was very clean and the home itself is pleasant but not as available as advertised.   You are still in someone else’s home and are aware of it. We thought the mattress to be somewhat uncomfortable. The room is in the front of the house with a large window facing the street. It is not a busy street but  it is also not a quiet suburban street. It was warm in Denver and we had to leave the window open with a fan in front of that in order to be comfortable.  Location worked well for us as we were there to visit close by family.","Denver"

The place was super neat and had great amenities. The location was a fantastic, quieter area that's only a quick walk or ride from some great parts of Denver. It was great place to use as a home base, but also great to just hang out in. 

I would be happy to stay there again!","Denver"

I’ll start with the owners—they were very responsive and accomodating when we asked to drop our bags off a bit early bevfore check in. They also left a generous helping of local coffee to be French pressed each morning—and it was super good coffee!

If there’s one thing we’d change about this place is that there’s not much within walking distance, but that’s out of everyone’s control. If you’re driving or don’t mind ubering everywhere, this is a fantastic spot.","Denver"

She had clean towels and wash cloths laid out on our bed, and an immaculate bedroom/bathroom for us to use. Her puppy was very friendly, and sweet :). Being new to the area, we asked for suggestions on live music, kombucha, and shopping. Morgan offered tons of ideas, and we checked out her suggestions with much delight! Morgan’s place is right across from The Noshery, which offers incredible lattes and breakfast burritos. You’re also a short drive to Tennyson, which has awesome local shops, restaurants, and breweries. Enjoyed a wonderful stay, and would definitely visit again!","Denver"

If you are wanting to spend time at this house or yard and walk around the neighborhood, this is not the place.  I would recommend this for anyone who needs a clean place to sleep.  Not the best location or home to spend your entire stay at.   Small but clean, the yard and neighborhood is not very functional.","Denver"

Close to a beautiful lake to go for a walk on a sunny day. Close to some supermarkets and KFC on the main road as well. We used Lyft to get to downtown (was $8 ish for two of us), but there are tram station and buses nearby. It is in a quite district of Denver. The room was cozy with a fridge and coffee machine (Becki left for us some coffee capsules as well). The room was on the first floor and had its own stylish bathroom, so we felt very private!

He also ensured he made up for the small inconvenience by getting us some pizzas the next day, which was very thoughtful.","Denver"
